# Baloons and More

Several times a year we enjoy a baloon festival in our back yard.  We can wander over to the park and watch the baloons
take off.  We can see them from our back yard and enjoy the beauty of the baloons in the sky.  The baloons often dip
into the lake in out back yard and then stream water as they clear our house by serveral feet.  I can't believe that we
live in such a beautiful place.
