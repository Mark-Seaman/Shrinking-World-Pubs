# Baloons and More

Several times a year we enjoy a baloon festival in our back yard.  We can wander over to the park and watch the baloons
take off.  We can see them from our back yard and enjoy the beauty of the baloons in the sky.  The baloons often dip
into the lake in out back yard and then stream water as they clear our house by serveral feet.  I can't believe that we
live in such a beautiful place.  

Sometimes we wander over to the park and watch them setup and inflate the baloons.  This year there were more baloons
than there have been in the past.  We can see them all from our back yard or walk over to the park for a closer look.

Sometimes we wake up to the characteristic sound of the baloons firing up their burners.  We hurry out onto our back 
porch so we can watch them pass over our house.  They often barely clear the houses and tree after dipping in our lake.
