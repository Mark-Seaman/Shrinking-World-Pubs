# The Photo Shoot

Stacie's last public event was a photo shoot with the grandkids and her mom present.  She had been planning it for a
while and traveled to South Dakota to bring her mom to Colorado so that she to participate.  She had a professional
photographer lined up and had arranged for the kids to have matching outfits.

Shortly after she returned from South Dakota with her mom she began getting ill.  At the time of the photo shoot she was
very jandiced and quite sick, but we didn't know why. A week later we realized that it was cancer.
