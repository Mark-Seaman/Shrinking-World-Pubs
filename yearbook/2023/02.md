# The Jesus Revolution

The Jesus Revolution was a Christian movement that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was characterized by a
renewed emphasis on personal faith, evangelism, and social justice. At the time we were known as Jesus Freaks. The
movement was influenced by the counterculture of the time, with many young people seeking spiritual fulfillment and
social change.

We took the opportunity with the release of the movie "Jesus Revolution" to dress up as hippies with our old friends to
celebrate our roots. We had a great time reminiscing about the past and sharing stories of how those days shaped our
lives.

It has been 49 years since I began following Jesus.  It hasn't always been easy, but my faith has sustained me through 
the ups and downs of life. I am grateful for the community of believers who have supported me along the way and for the 
opportunities to grow in faith and understanding with others.

There are some crazy things happening in the world today, but I take comfort in knowing that God is in control. I am
grateful for the people that he has put in my life to share the journey with me.
