# The Jesus Revolution

The Jesus Revolution was a Christian movement that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was characterized by a
renewed emphasis on personal faith, evangelism, and social justice. At the time we were known as Jesus Freaks. The
movement was influenced by the counterculture of the time, with many young people seeking spiritual fulfillment and
social change.

We took the opportunity of the release of the movie "Jesus Revolution" to dress up as hippies with our old friends to
celebrate our roots. We had a great time reminiscing about the past and sharing stories of how those days has shaped our
lives.
