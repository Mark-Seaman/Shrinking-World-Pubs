# Grandkid Cuteness

From the time her kids were born, Rachel has consistently captured the most precious moments.  She is quite the artist
with a camera.  She does the most amazing work that reminds me of Anne Geddes.  I am so grateful for the beautiful
pictures she has taken of my grandkids.  I have been able to watch them grow up through her lens.  I am so thankful for
the joy they bring to my life. 

She has also launched an Instagram site to review childrens books.  Each posting has a photo and a review of the book.
She has now posted over 200 Literary Sprouts reviews.  I am so proud of her for the work she has done.
