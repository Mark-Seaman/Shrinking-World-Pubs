# Medieval Festival

Cassie's 10th birthday party was a Medieval Festival.  This included a court, jousting, archery and crafts.  This is the
best birthday party I've ever been to.  Sam and Josiah did a fantastic job.  Cassie's Grandma and Great Grandma were
able to attend in costume. A good time was had by all.
