# Mike Webb

We first met Mike and Barb Webb in 1985 when they were preparing to move to Greeley to plant a Vineyard Church.  
Stacie and I were 25 at the time and helped from the very beginning.  We were part of the core group that helped them
start the church and were there for the next 14 years.  We led home groups, served on the board, and helped with
anything that came up.

Mike and Barb taught us about a life of ministry.  They both served faithfully and sacrificially for decades.  I was
able to speak at Mike's memorial service and reflect on all we learned from him.  I owe him a great debt of gratitude
for his example and friendship.

It has been almost 50 years since Stacie and I became active in church life.  We have been part of many churches over
those years. But Mike and Barb had an enormous impact on our lives and we are grateful for their friendship and example.
It was tough to say goodbye to Mike, but we know we will see him again soon.
