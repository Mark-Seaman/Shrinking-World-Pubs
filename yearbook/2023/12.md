# The Love of My Life

We had a fairy tale romance.  We met in 6th grade, fell in love at 15, and were married at 19.  We had three kids and
three grandkids. We each had multiple careers and we worked a software business together.  We always did ministry together and
chose activities that we could do together.  We were best friends.  We were married for 45 years.  We had a great life together.

We've owned four houses and 17 cars.  We've traveled the world together. This life has been so much more that I could have
ever imagined.  I am so grateful for the time we had together.  She is the best person I have ever known.  She made me the
man I am today.  I miss her so much!
