# Duke and Marie Lancaster

We had a wonderful time with some friends of ours this year.  Duke was in group that Stacie was coaching.  The group
started during the pandemic and became a highlight of the month for the participants.  Duke is one of three Missions
Mobizers in the Vineyard USA.   They do a great deal of travel and live in a motorhome.  They came to visit us in
Greeley and lived with us for several weeks between travels.  We had a great time together.  That was one of the
greatest highlights of the year for me.
