# Duke and Marie Lancaster

We had a wonderful time with some friends of ours this year.  Duke was in group that Stacie was coaching.  The group
started during the pandemic and became a highlight of the month for the participants.  Duke is one of three Missions
Mobizers in the Vineyard USA.   They do a great deal of travel and live in a motorhome.  They came to visit us in
Greeley and lived with us for several weeks between travels.  We had a great time together.  That was one of the
greatest highlights of the year for me.

We spent many hours just sharing stories and experiences.  I'm convinced that Duke has the most amazing stories of 
anyone I have met.  We had a great time together.  They are a truly amazing couple.  We are looking forward to seeing
more of them in the future, when the are not traveling all over the world.
