# Society for Creative Anachronism


The Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) provides a vibrant and immersive experience for its members who are
passionate about history and culture. 

Josiah, Sam, and Cassie embody the diverse range of interests and talents within
the SCA community. Sam's dedication to accurate detail as a scribe for the local duchy showcases her commitment to
preserving historical authenticity. Josiah's engagement in combat events not only demonstrates his physical prowess but
also his appreciation for the martial traditions of past eras. Cassie's recognition for her craftsmanship reflects the
value placed on traditional arts and skills within the SCA.

Participating in the SCA has not only allowed Josiah, Sam, and Cassie to hone their individual talents but has also
enabled them to forge strong bonds with like-minded individuals. The sense of camaraderie and belonging fostered by the
SCA speaks to the inclusive and welcoming nature of the organization. Through their involvement in the SCA, Josiah, Sam,
and Cassie have not only delved deep into the rich tapestry of Medieval European cultures but have also created lasting
memories and friendships that will endure for years to come. Their contributions to the SCA community, whether through
crafting, combat, or scribing, serve as a testament to the enduring appeal and relevance of historical reenactment.

In addition to the SCA, Sam has been involved in several different events for famous authors.  She has had several pieces
published in sci-fi and fantasy publications and has been a panelist at a recent conference.  She has had an opportunity
to interact with many of the top authors.
