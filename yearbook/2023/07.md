# Grandma's Trike

Grandma Stacie was thrilled when she got her new E-Trike. It was hi-tech and fully equipped with electric assist.
Living on the Poudre River Trail, she knew it would be the perfect way to spend time with her grandkids outdoors. The
idea of being able to ride with Grandma was something that everyone looked forward to.

With the electric assist, Grandma Stacie found it much easier to pull the kids in the trailer behind her. They would
giggle and squeal with delight as the wind rushed past them, their hair flying wildly in the breeze. It wasn't long
before the E-Trike became a staple in their visits to Grandma Stacie's and she cherished every moment spent with them.

However, as the grandkids grew older and bigger, they soon outgrew the trailer. At first, they protested, insisting they
could still fit, but Grandma Stacie continued to adapt and find new ways to enjoy their rides together. This was one of
many fun activities they shared, and she was determined to keep the tradition alive.
