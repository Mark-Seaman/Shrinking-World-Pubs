# The Nap Drive

One of the main characteristic event of Ruby's and Valor's lives is Grandma's Nap Drive.  Three or four days a week,
Stacie took the grandkids on a long drive to help them take a nap.  She would drive around the countryside for a couple
of hours.  They badly needed the nap but would not take it at home.  The drive was a great way to get them to sleep so they could
be more pleasant to be around.  This started several years ago and became a regular feature of our life together.
After the kids slept they were often treated to cookies, smoothies, or a carwash.  The nap drive turned into a major bonding event that the kids will never forget.
