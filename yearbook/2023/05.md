# The Nap Drive

Ruby and Valor eagerly looked forward to their nap drives with Grandma Stacie. They would get settled in their carseats
and Stacie would give them gummy worms or fruit snacks to munch on as they set off on their journey. The kids would soon
drift off to sleep in the backseat of her car. As Stacie navigated through the country roads around our town, the kids
would watch the trees and fields pass by as they slowly succumbed to slumber.

She would play kids songs on the sound system in her fancy Tesla and gradually turn down the volume and the kids relaxed.
The music helped them relax and fall asleep. The gentle hum of the engine and the rhythmic motion of the car would lull them into a peaceful state of rest. And as they slept, Stacie would steal glances at their peaceful faces in the rearview mirror, grateful for these quiet moments with her beloved grandchildren.

Once the kids had gotten their much-needed nap, Stacie would often stop at a local bakery for cookies or a nearby
smoothie shop for a treat. The kids would wake up to delicious goodies and happy smiles, making the nap drive even more
special.  Sometime Grandma would take them through a car wash and the kids would love the green and purple foam bubbles
and water and big brushes.

As the time went by, the nap drives became a cherished tradition in Ruby and Valor's lives. They would reminisce about
the countless drives they had taken with Grandma, the peaceful moments spent together, and the joy of waking up to a
special treat.

The nap drive not only helped the kids get the rest they needed but also created lasting memories and deepened the bond
between them and their Grandma Stacie. It was a simple yet meaningful tradition that will always hold a special place
in their hearts.
