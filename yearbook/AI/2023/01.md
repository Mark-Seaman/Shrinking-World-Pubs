# The Joy of Family

Since the pandemic, I have been spending a lot of time with my family. I have been able to bond with my kids and
grandkids in ways that I never thought possible. We have had deep conversations, shared our fears and dreams, and
laughed until our stomachs hurt. I have come to realize that family is truly a gift, and I am grateful for the time I
have been able to spend with them.  We developed a tradition of having a family pizza night every Friday.
