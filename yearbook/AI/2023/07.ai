Expand this into a story about Grandma Stacie


# E-Trike

Stacie got a new E-Trike.  We live on the Poudre River Trail and she wanted to be able to ride with the grandkids.  With
the electric assist she was able to pull the kids in a trailer.  She loved the trike and rode it all the time.  It was a
great way to get exercise and enjoy the outdoors.  The grandkids loved it until they got too big to fit in the trailer.
