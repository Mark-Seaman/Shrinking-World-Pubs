# How You Can Help

## Pray

We believe in prayer.  We believe that God hears and answers our prayers.  

We pray for a miraculous healing but understand that this often doesn't happen.

We pray for God's love and presence to be felt by Stacie and her family.  We pray for peace and comfort.  We pray for strength and courage.  We pray for a miracle.


## Encourage

Stacie has always been a source of encouragement to others.  She has always been a source of strength and inspiration.  She has always been a source of love and support.  She has always been a source of hope and optimism.

We hope that you will share your thoughts and feelings with Stacie.  We hope that you will share your memories and experiences.  We hope that you will share your love and support.  We hope that you will share your hope and optimism.
