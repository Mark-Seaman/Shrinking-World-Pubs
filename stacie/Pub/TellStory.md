# Tell Your Story

I have talked with dozens of people in the last week.   Everyone has a story of Stacie's incredible generosity of
spirit.  

Please share your story.  I will gather these together and publish them on this web site.   What better way to
celebrate her life together.  You contribution will be a source of strength and inspiration to others.

Email your story to **"mark@seamanfamily.org"** to be incoporated into this website.

I intend to begin working on a book about Stacie's life.  I will use these stories as the basis for the book.  
The early results will be viewable on this website.  The final book will be available for purchase on Amazon.com.
