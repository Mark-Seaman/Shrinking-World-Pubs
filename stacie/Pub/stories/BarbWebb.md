Stacie was my co-pilot!

I first met Stacie and Mark in 1985, when they were just 25.  We were moving to Greeley to plant a church.  The
Seamans had moved to Greeley a year earlier. Stacie had two young children under 4 but still found time to be deeply
involved in the chaos of church planting.  

We first met as a group in our condo and soon began meeting in the Greeley Rec Center on Sunday evening.  We then moved
to a school gymnasium where we set up chairs each week to conduct our service.  The Seamans helped haul and set up the
equipment.  We were a rag-tag group of young families, college students, and singles.  We were all in transition.  It was
a time of great excitement and anticipation.  We were all in it together.  We were a team.  We were a family.  We were
a church.

After about a year, we moved to a storefront on 9th Avenue where the church is at today.  We've now remodeled the building
at least five times.  Over the years many things have changed, but the orginal vision of those early days remains
unchanged. Our goal was to reach the lost, the broken, the hurting, the lonely, the addicted, the abused, the   
abandoned, the hopeless, the helpless, the poor, the rich, the young, the old, the sick, the healthy, the educated, the 
uneducated, the unloved, the unlovely, the unchurched, the churched, the religious, the irreligious, the moral, the
immoral, the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful, the rich, the poor, the happy, the sad, the lonely, the loved.

We want to be a blessing to our city.
From the first days that we met the Seamans, we were a team. I don't think we could have successfully planted the
Greeley Vineyard in 1985 and beyond, without Mark and Stacie's input and guidance. They shared our vision and goals.
Their counsel was wise, timely, and invaluable.

Stacie was Mike's administrative secretary in the 90s, and she was instrumental in guiding Mike in making key decisions
that would assure the future of the Greeley Vineyard Church.

She and I led the Women's Ministry for many years, planning, teaching and ministering together to dozens of dear ladies,
many of whom are still here at the church today! Through weekly Bible studies, many lovely Christmas teas, and
life-changing women's retreats in the mountains, Stacie helped lead the direction of our ministry.

One of my outstanding memories of our adventures together is getting caught in a massive blizzard which struck during an
October weekend at a weekend women's conference in Colorado Springs. The blizzard was raging that first night as I drove
a van full of very scared ladies through the streets with less than a car-length of visibility. Stacie was calm and
confident as she co-piloted us to the motel, which took nearly two hours to go five miles! While we were trapped for two
days in the motel, Stacie personally encouraged, counseled, calmed and comforted each lady, who just wanted to be
"safely home!‚Äù

She was my co-pilot. When I was anxious and stressed, Stacie was calm and steadfast. When I was reactionary and
frustrated, she was thoughtful and kind. I trusted her wisdom, her insight, her deep commitment to Jesus and her
faithfulness. When the Lord took our ministries in different directions, I feared losing her, but she assured me that
our deep friendship would always be strong... and it truly has been!

I expect to see Stacie again soon, along with my beloved husband Mike, riding with the multitude of Saints, right beside
Jesus at His coming again!

Until then, Stacie, rejoice in achieving the ultimate goal of every faithful servant. You are Safely Home!
