# So appreciate your friendship

by Duke Lancaster

I am so sorry you are going through this. You have been so encouraging to me over the past few years and I can't thank
you enough. Marie and I are praying for you and Mark. Lord, let the seed that Stacie has sown in others be returned back
to her and Mark in this season, pressed down, shaken together and running over.
