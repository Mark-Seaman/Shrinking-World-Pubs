My relationship with Aunt Stacie has always felt easy. After I got married and had kids, she became a mentor and trusted
advisor. Our visits have always had great conversations and fun adventures.

In 2019, Stacie invited my oldest daughter and I went on a trip to London. On that trip I began healing from burnout.
After I returned, with her encouragement, I started writing. This began a closer partnership and our time together
expanded to include coaching, writing inspiration, editing, and guidance in learning new skills.

In the past year, I have written and completed my first book. We have been in the midst of editing and formatting and
had hoped to publish before this Christmas.

Through the years I have been able to rely on Stacie for a variety of things. But no matter what the circumstances were,
I always knew what to expect from her. It didn't matter if we were in a stressful travel situation in Europe, solving a
writing problem, or if I was coming to her with frustrations.

She would always show up with love, empathy, honesty, and wisdom. She would have insight into my situation that she
would explain in her matter-of-fact way. She could see other circumstances that were affecting me in ways that I had
not even considered. She knew my history in ways that few others do.

She taught me to be compassionate with myself and fight perfectionism. She had no problem editing out what didn't match
our goals. "That does not fit this right now" she would say. We navigated realistic goal setting, times of intense
productivity, and new writing tech tools. She taught me how to set deadlines that push me and stretch my capacity. And
stressed the importance of focus.

However, this was just one dimension of our coaching sessions and in-person visits. Stacie also taught me how to make
space for relationships and caring for those around me. When I got too task-oriented, she would remind me who all these
tasks were for.

Stacie was the embodiment of grace. She taught me that it began with self- compassion. She would repeatedly say "You are
a human being and not a human doing", usually with a hand on my shoulder or a hug.

With her guidance, I learned how to have seasons of quiet and rest. She encouraged me to take time off in the summer.
And to enjoy Christmas break with my family. She would remind me that time spent homemaking and loving my children
mattered even more than tasks on a list.

The raw truth is that I've never pictured my life without her guidance. But here is what I do know:

I want to continue her legacy of living intentionally with a relationship-focused life. To impact the lives of those
around me positively. I want to see people for where they are and love them well.

I want to give them words, tools, and compassion to help others be the best versions of themselves.

I want to help moms, teachers, young adults, and writers who are deep in burnout and need to heal.

She always wanted me to be confident that I had something to offer. Whenever I would doubt myself, she would encourage
me with truth and firmly rebuff my concerns.

She told me a few months ago, "Your frustrations and feeling overwhelmed right now is your street cred. It is how you
can connect authentically with your readers. You know what they are going through and you also know the way out."

At the end of each coaching session and writing meeting, we would map out the next steps. And set our plans (based on
current information) for the next month.

So in that coaching-with-Stacie-mode I have a few questions for you:

* What can we celebrate?
* What obstacles or difficulties are you currently wrestling with?
* What does reasonable progress look like for you in this next month?

As we all grieve and do our best, let's be kind to ourselves and each other. I hope you will take some time to think
about your unique answers to these questions and what that means for your January and the months beyond.
