# The Love of My Life

by Mark Seaman

I've known Stacie most of my life. We first fell in love at 15 but were not ready to get married. By 19 we entered into
a relationship that would shape both of our lives.

If I were to live five lifetimes, I would not expect to find anyone like Stacie. She is the love of my life. She is my
lover, my confidant, my best friend, my partner, my companion, my wife. She is the mother of my children and the
grandmother of my grandchildren. She is my soulmate.

Stacie is the most loving person I have ever known. She is kind and compassionate. She is generous and forgiving. She is
both intelligent and wise (often a rare combination) and always knows the right thing to say.

She has shaped my life in ways I can not describe. She has made me a better person. She has called me out when I was
wrong. She has encouraged me when I was right.

She has given me the courage to fight and the courage to stand down. She has cheered me at times and stopped me from
foolishness at others.

Stacie, I stand with you now. I will be by your side always, the way you have been by mine. Together we will face
whatever life brings. I love you.
