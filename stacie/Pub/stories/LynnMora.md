# My Best Friend

by Lynn Mora

"Wherever a beautiful soul has been, there is a trail of beautiful memories.”

Thinking of a time Stacie encouraged me is like thinking of a time my heart was beating. Stacie was truly one
of the most giving, caring, encouraging people I know. She was this way naturally, seemingly without having
to work at it. When someone needed something, Stacie was always willing to step in and provide what was
needed or connect the person to someone else who could help. 

I first met Stacie in 1986, before Juan and I were
married. Since that time, Stacie and I have been in kinship/ small groups together, Mothers of Preschoolers,
and most recently in a "Micro Group” with another, wonderful, longtime friend, Elen Hunt, which has met
online for a few years. No matter the venue, Stacie cared, loved, and gave of herself.

One of my strongest earlier memories of Stacie was back when Juan and I were first married. We were broke
college students and had about $4.00 to our names. I became ill and needed to go to the student health center
for treatment, but the health center charged a $25 copay. We weren't sure what to do. 

I called Stacie and asked
for a loan for the $25, just until payday from my work study job. An hour or two later, Stacie arrived at my
workplace, with two young children in tow, and handed me an envelope. I thanked her and gave her a big hug.
When I opened the envelope, I found a check for $100 and a note that said, "This is a gift, not a loan. Family
takes care of each other.” I burst into tears, called Stacie and thanked her, and headed over to the student
health center.

Countless times since then, Stacie has encouraged me, prayed for and with me, given me wise counsel, and
come to my rescue. In our small "kinship” groups over the years, we worshiped together and prayed for each
other. We went on Women's Retreats together. As young moms, we were in MOPS together. I think Samuel, my
firstborn, was about a month old when Stacie called me and invited me to MOPS. "I think you'll have a blast,”
she said. I went to that first MOPS meeting, and she was right: it was a blast. 

Whenever I didn't have access to a
working car, Stacie would pick me up in that big, 8-cylinder van, along with other moms and their
preschoolers who didn't have rides. When Stacie started a bilingual MOPS group, she invited me to be on the
steering committee, which I gladly accepted. That group was an adventure, and Stacie worked hard to keep us
all focused. There were times when I thought she might be frustrated with us, but she always said she wasn't.

Things didn't seem to rattle her like they would me. She loved us, warts and all.
As we raised our kids, worked our careers, and went to different churches for a while, we didn't spend as much
time together. However, once we realized we lived in the same town again, having both moved to Windsor in
2009, we started hanging out together again. It was wonderful to catch up with both Mark and Stacie! We got
together with them and with other people for breakfast, for games, and for dinner. 

Mark and Stacie had Juan
and me over for dinner weekly for a while, just when the pandemic lockdown was opening up. It was our "soft
open.” We would take turns contributing food and would enjoy watching an episode of Picard, then The
Chosen, together. Juan and I valued those evenings considerably. 

All of these times and activities illustrate
something I told Juan and Mark recently, which is that Stacie was always starting stuff. She took the initiative
to begin a group, or a "micro group,” to invite people over, to start a monthly breakfast with other women, or
to provide something for someone. 

Just the day before Stacie died, I told someone I couldn't imagine a world
without Stacie in it. Well, here we are. We know she is in the great heavenly cloud of witnesses, but it is not the
same, and I miss her terribly. 

It makes me realize that I want to demonstrate more "Stacie-ness.” I want to be
more giving, more caring, more loving, and more encouraging like Stacie always was. I pray for God to give
me more wisdom like he gave Stacie. I want to start stuff and be involved in some good shenanigans.
