# My Business Partner

by Eric Williams

For a few years, Mark, Stacie, and I were in a business partnership together. Stacie's role was mostly focused on the
administrative tasks involved in running a business. I could talk about all of Stacie's work traits – detail-oriented,
diligent, hardworking, etc. – all exceptional, but those are not my strongest memories of working with Stacie.

What I remember as I think back on that time was how she was the human glue of the company. As with any company, there
were many hard decisions to make (direction of the company, strategies, how to allocate resources, and ultimately the
dissolution of the company). Our board meetings were always around Stacie's kitchen table.

The first thing I remember is always feeling welcome (even when we had hard decisions to discuss). We would always start
with updates on our families which set the tone of what was truly important. If you know Mark or I, you know that we can
have strong opinions. 

I can't even remember most of the topics that were discussed but I do remember how Stacie would
intently listen to whatever was said and then I remember phrases like "What I think Eric is saying is…”, "I think the
main thing Mark is concerned about is…”, "let me have your thoughts on this idea…”, "maybe a good compromise solution
would be…”. Always with grace, always with kindness. And when that much grace and kindness was flooding the
conversation, it couldn't help but permeate what Mark and I said also.

These are not the attributes we commonly think of in terms of a powerful businessperson. But make no mistake – power was
there. Those are the attributes that avoided standoffs and facilitated an environment where the best decisions could be
made.

I learned from Stacie the power of kindness in my words, the power of making each person involved feel important and
cared for, and the power of truly listening (not only to the words but the feelings behind the words). Our lives as
humans are filled with interactions involving difficult decisions and/or difficult discussions. I now try to bring those
attributes that I saw modeled by Stacie with me to each of those discussions.
