# Share Your Memories

## Tell Your Story

Words have power, especially in difficult times. I have talked with dozens of people in the last week.   Everyone has a story of Stacie's incredible generosity of
spirit.  

Many of you have benefited greatly from Stacie's love and support.
Please share your story.  What better way to
celebrate her life together.  Your contribution will be a source of strength and inspiration to others.

If you have a story to share, please write it down and post it or email your story to "**mark@seamanfamily.org**" to be
incoporated into this website.

Think of a time when Stacie's words and actions were a source of strength and inspiration and made a difference in your life.

### Stacie Seaman: A Life of Serving Others
by Mark Seaman

As an author I like to write about amazing people who have made a difference.
Stacie was a person who lived her life serving others but was never subserviant.  She understood things like few others about the nature of love and
relationships.  She was a person who was always there for you.  She had an enormous generosity of spirit.  Her story needs to be told.

I intend to begin working on a book about Stacie's life.  The plan was to help Stacie write her autobiography, but we
ran out of time.  I am collecting stories from the people that she touched and will use these as the basis for the book.  
The early results will be viewable on this website.  The final book will be available for purchase on Amazon.com.

Guildelines for writing your story:
