# Stacie's Place

This website is dedicated to Stacie Seaman who gives so much to so many.  She is a source of inspiration and strength to
all who know her.  She is a loving wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend.  She is a teacher, a mentor, and
a leader.  She serves her family, her community, and her church.  

Recent events have brought Stacie to a place where she needs our help and encouragement.  This website provides news for
the ongoing detour with cancer and information about how you can help.  We have created this site to streamline
communication and coordination of support. 

With the many people that Stacie has touched, it is difficult to keep everyone informed.  This site provides a central
location for news and updates.  You can also subscribe to receive email updates.  We have also created a place for
sharing encouragement and memories.  We have a page for signing up to help in various ways. 

Please join us in supporting Stacie and her family.
