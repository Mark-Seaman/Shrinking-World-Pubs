# Please Connect with Mark

Stacie was the social director for our entire family.  With her gone we are all in danger of becoming isolated hermits.

There are many ways to connect with me.  Choose the one that works best for you.


## Email

I would love to hear from you.  Please send me email at "**mark@seamanfamily.org**" or call me at **970-481-6240**.

## Marco Polo

I have been using the Marco Polo app to stay in touch with my family and to coordinate care when Stacie was
ill.  It is a video messaging app that allows you to send and receive video messages at any time.

## Video Appointments

It is often difficult to find time to talk. I have been using an application that looks at my calendar and 
lets you schedule a video appointment with me.  View Mark's Calendar to pick
a 15 minute spot.  The meeting will also have an embedded video link so we can talk face to face.

## Take Me to Lunch

We've set up a meal train to help with meals.  You can sign up to take me to lunch or dinner.
