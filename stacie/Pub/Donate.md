## Prometa

Stacie's last major project was to create a working partnership between Shrinking World and Prometa.

Shrinking World Solutions was founded in 2007 by her husband Mark.  The mission was to provide software development services.  In 2014 Eric Williams and Stacie joined as business partners.  In 2023 the company changed its name to Shrinking World and its goal to focus primarily on training in software development skills.

Mark and Martha Hendrickson cofounded the [Prometa](https://www.pro-meta.org/) organization with a vision to train church leaders by using distance education.  

They are one of the leading providers of graduate level theological education in the Spanish speaking world.
They provide Docorate, Masters, and Undergraduate degrees and have dual acreditation as a state university and theological university.
Prometa is expanding rapidly and now has 64 professors, and students around the world in 20 countries.

The partnership between Shrinking World and Prometa started as a loose association in 2007, and blossomed 2023.
Stacie and Mark have been engaged in providing an enterprise-level software application to manage the student registation process for Prometa.  

Currently we have invested a thousand hours of effort into the project and have completed eight software releases for Prometa.  The application is being used to manage all student revistrations for the university. 

Stacie's loss has left a hole that needs to be filled in order to expand the existing application and tackle additional project.
If you have any of the following skills you could be useful in this partnership.

- Software development
- Project management
- Marketing
- Education

We have a fantastic team and would welcome your contribution.  Your voluntary service could be valuable to the entire organization which could have an impact on nations.

Please consider offering your talents to this worthy cause.
