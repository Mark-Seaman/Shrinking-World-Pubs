# The Meaning of Life

by Todd Beilman

What is the meaning of life? I have been asking this question for years. I hope that you have been pondering it too.

It is impossible to sum up a person's life in an hour.  But we have tried to give you a glimpse into the life of Stacie Seaman. 
Stacie was a complex person with a lot of different facets.  You have heard from many people today about the different
aspects of her life.  I want to focus on gave her life meaning.

"She Loved Well !"

That seems to be the theme of her life.  No matter how people knew her - family, friends, work, neighbors, church -
everyone tells the same story of her love and kindness.

She provided a living example that serves as an inspiration for all of us.

The meaning of life is to live a life with meaning!  The details of that meaning are different for each of us.  
But the common thread is living true to the unique way you have been created.

What does that mean for you?  How will you live a life with meaning?
