Childhood, Adulthood, Mid-life, Old age.   I've had the privilege of traveling in Greece in every season.

I've been there with my parents and siblings, my wife and kids and nieces, and now with my new friends.

Everywhere we went the memories flooded in.  It was overwhelming at times and there were often tears.  Recently losses were never far from my mind.

But this trip was a powerful reminder to me of God's care and provision.  I saw how God has been with me in every season even though each was so different.

I reflected on all the people that have been such an important part of my life journey.  I recognized that I still have a desire to live fully in this new season of life.  

I am now ready to embrace the future, knowing that God will lead and guide wherever life takes me.
