## Veria / Meteora 

This morning we stop in Veria (Beroea of the New Testament), where Paul and Silas were sent by friends after being
accused of treason in Thessalonika (Acts 17:5-15). We visit the Bema, where Paul is said to have stood and preached the
Gospel to the local community. Next we continue to Kalambaka to see the striking scenery of the hanging monasteries of
Meteora. Perched on top of huge rocks that seem to be suspended in mid-air are ageless monasteries where we can see
exquisite specimens of Byzantine art. There are 24 monasteries in total, with 6 currently inhabited. We visit one of
them before checking into our hotel for dinner and overnight.
