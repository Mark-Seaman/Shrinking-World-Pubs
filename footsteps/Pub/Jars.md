# The Power of Love and Encouragement

by Beverly Medrano

As we walked the ancient ruins of Philippi and visualizing a  booming city of people passionate in their faith who held
a very special  place in Paul’s heart. This was the birthplace of the first church in  Europe, the epicenter of the
early church and I  was here! I was amazed and so humbled to walk the hallowed ground in  which our very faith was
birthed. 

Paul’s heart for the people was  evident and the mutual love, encouragement and affection of the  Philippians kept him
going during some of his darkest moments.  May I keep that heart and passion alive as I tread the deeper waters of
ministry and my faith, wherever He chooses to lead me and whoever He  brings across my path. 

Our lives are vessels, created to be filled with the love of Christ and to pour out that love  on others. May we be
faithful to that calling and may our lives be a  sweet fragrance to those around us.
