# Island Cruise

by Beverly Medrano

---

I loved the island cruise.  We had luxury accommodations and traveled to three different islands.  It would be nice someday to return and spend longer at each place.  Perhaps I will do that someday.  The food was delicious and the people were so friendly.  I would recommend this cruise to anyone who loves the sea and the sun.
