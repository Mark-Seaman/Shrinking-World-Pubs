I've recently lost my wife and have been learning how to live again.  My recovery has been quite remarkable but it is far from complete.

I've had an amazing life, filled with so much joy and opportunity.  I'm so grateful for everything that has happened and recognize that every good and perfect gift comes from God.

There is a deep sense of gratitude and contentment that I feel even though I believe that the best years are behind me.  I've learned to be alone without being lonely and worked to surround myself with friends.

As I prepared for this trip my greatest desire was to find people that I could travel with.  Most of the people that I know have many commitments that would prevent them from traveling. Travel has always been important to me but I don't want to travel alone.

Suddenly I found myself surrounded by people that I really enjoyed.  We laughed and cried. We shared wonderful food and wine. We swam in the Aegean Sea and tromped around ruins.  We discussed history and current events.  We prayed together. I found my people.

This was my greatest longing.  By the end of the trip I began to feel alive again in a way that I thought was impossible.  I had a desire for adventure and an anticipation of an extraordinary future.  Perhaps the best is not behind afterall.
