## Corinth/Nafplio 

Today we drive to Corinth to visit the archaeological site where the apostle Paul worked for 18 months with tentmakers
Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:1-18). We also see the handmade Corinth Canal connecting the Aegean Sea with the Ionian
Sea. Next we stop and see the ancient port of Cenchrea, where Paul stopped during his mission to the area. We learn
about Isthmus, a trade center where Paul visited to spread the word amongst the crowds. Next we make our way to the
beautiful seaport town of Nafplio, the first capital of Greece and a location rich in Venetian architecture, cobbled
squares, and towering castles with commanding views of the Argolic Gulf. Here we view the water castle of Bourtzi and
Palamidi Castle (note there are 999 steps to the top of the castle so, time permitting, we may have the option to climb
to the top for an impressive view of the gulf). We return to Athens for dinner and overnight.
