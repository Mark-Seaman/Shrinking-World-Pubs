# Paul in Jail

by Pam Balla

DAY 3 â€“ Phillipi

---

So much about walking the steps of Paul in Greece brought the Bible  to Life, but the most impactful and Life changing moment happened to me  when I saw Paul's prison.

Walking up I had to step away and  take in the topography and God's powerful intentionality.  I could  envision the structures and streets all made of gorgeous white marble,  the bustling crowds at the busy market and the voice of Paul praising  and singing of the Glory of God .It took my breath away seeing how God  had used every detail for Paul's impactful message of faith and  salvation.

The prison where Paul was left to  die stands right above and so close to the busiest populated market  at  the time  The miracle events of Paul's everlasting Faith, and Praise and  Worship were not only heard daily by the other prisoners and the  jailers but also by all who were in the bustling market.

Then  they were actually felt with the miracle earthquake that freed the  prisoners which spread even by his captors and jailer who were brought  to Christ by Paul and helped to spread the word. God used everything  Paul experienced even when Paul was stoned and yet continued to Preach  of the glory of God.

As I stood there looking at the prison I could feel the earthquake that freed Paul.

It filled my heart with so much trust, faith and Love for our amazing Heavenly father who I know truly  does have a wonderful plan for each one of our lives. What a joy is it  to be able to share with others ( and all who will listen) how visiting  Paul's prison has impacted my life.
