# Trusting the Stream
The Healing Power of God's Presence in My Life.

DAY 3 – Phillipi

---

I’ve often wondered what my God-given gift is, and now it has been revealed to me.

In Philippi, Greece, Paul baptized Lydia. Afterward, she opened her home to him and his companions, playing a key role in the early church. Her story speaks to me deeply.

Grief has a way of breaking you, stripping away confidence and identity. It brought me closer to the Lord, but also left me seeking healing.

When I placed my feet in the stream where Lydia was baptized, I felt the Holy Spirit’s presence. The water brought healing, rebuilding my spirit. I began to love myself again, feeling worthy of God’s love and able to love others even more.

As I stood in the stream, I felt grief give way to joy. I trusted the Lord with my journey, and He showed me my purpose. I came out of the stream feeling renewed and alive, with my identity restored.

I now understand that my gift is to bring people together—to help them trust and love each other and the Lord. Like Lydia, I aim to honor God with my life, trusting in His work and spreading His word.

Lord, thank You for Lydia’s gift. I will treasure it always.

* John 13:34
* Matthew 22:37-40
