## Thessaloniki 

Today we arrive at Thessaloniki, named after Alexander the Great’s sister. The city features prominently in the New
Testament, at which time this provincial capital was considered a world cultural center. This community was the center
of Paul’s activities in Northern Greece. It is where he preached and founded a church, and he wrote two epistles to the
people of Thessaloniki (Acts 17:1-9; 1 Thessalonians; 2 Thessalonians). This evening we enjoy a welcome dinner at our
hotel.
