# Day 5 â€“ Tuesday, September 24, 2024 

## Kalambaka / Athens 

Today we depart our hotel and drive to Athens. We stop at Thermopylae, the location where the Greeks victoriously fought
for their freedom during the Greco-Persian wars in 480 BC. We see the statue of Leonidas, king of the Greek city-state
Sparta. Next we continue to Athens, where we have a panoramic orientation tour and may have some free time to explore.
Dinner and overnight in Athens.
