## Hydra / Egina / Poros 

After transferring from Athens to Piraeus by motor coach, we set sail for the Saronic Islands of Greece in the Saronic
Gulf. Our first stop is the island of Hydra, where we have free time for strolling, shopping, and swimming. Next, it’s
on to the island of Egina (Aegina), passing through the narrow strait separating the Peloponnesian coast from the island
of Poros. Upon arrival in Egina we have the option of joining an excursion to the Temple of Aphaia (cost not included)
or taking a walk around the main town. The lovely Egina is only 31 miles from Athens, and is a popular getaway for
Athenians during the summer months. After lunch served on board we sail to Poros in the southern Agrosaronic Gulf. We
have free time to explore Poros – we could visit ancient Trizina, see the ruins of the Russian Dockyard, or take a
romantic stroll in the Lemon Forest. After sailing back to Piraeus port we transfer to our hotel for dinner and
overnight.
