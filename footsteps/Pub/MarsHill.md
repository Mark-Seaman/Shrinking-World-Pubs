# Mars Hill

by Carrie Farrell

DAY 6 â€“ Athens

---

Mars Hill was a definite highlight of our trip for me! In these two photos, we see Karen Davison (aka KD) raising her
hands in praise. I'm in the other one with Linda (to my right) listening to Mark Forman give his sermon. People who
weren't part of our group listened intently to Mark as he spoke, exemplifying Paul's courage, which touched my heart. 

In the photo of KD, we see a young man in the lower right part of the frame. He sat directly in front of Mark listening
to his message. I prayed that this man would be touched by the Word of God and want to know more! It was interesting to
me how slippery the rock was up on Mars Hill, seemingly polished by the many feet traversing it over time - knowing that
it is a special place not just in Athens but in the heart of believers.
