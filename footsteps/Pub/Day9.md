# Day 9 â€“ Saturday, September 28, 2024 

## Athens

This day is full of endless opportunities! We are free to shop, dine, take on private sightseeing excursions, or just
relax. This is the perfect chance to enjoy free time in the Plaka area, the ancient city of Athens. This full free day
is a gift to ourselves like none other. Dinner and overnight at our hotel.
