## Athens

Today in Athens we visit the Acropolis, the Parthenon, Areopagus, and Mars Hill, where the apostle Paul delivered his
well-known sermon (Acts 17:15-34). We see the Acropolis Museum, then have a tour of the Parliament House, the Academy,
Omonia Square, and the Panathenaic Stadium. We have free time in the Plaka area, the ancient city of Athens. Dinner and
overnight at our hotel.
