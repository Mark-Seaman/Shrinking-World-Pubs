# Monastaries on the Rocks

DAY 4 – Meteora

---

Visiting Meteora left me completely awestruck. I captured this photo of a unique rock formation that resembles a sphinx, shaped and carved over centuries by the relentless forces of nature. The landscape of Meteora is otherworldly, a place where towering rock pillars seem to defy gravity and logic. These natural stone columns, rising majestically against the sky, evoke a sense of wonder and mystery that feels almost supernatural.

What struck me most was the idea that these rocks, in their raw and imposing form, provided a place for early monks to build their monasteries high above the ground. Perched so far from the world below, these places of worship became sanctuaries where spiritual seekers could feel as if they were reaching for heaven itself. It’s as if divine hands sculpted the land with care and imagination, turning stone into a breathtaking canvas of art and serenity.

Walking among these monumental formations was humbling, each step a reminder of the power of time and nature combined. The view alone was captivating, but the knowledge of its use as a haven for devotion added a layer of reverence. Meteora felt like more than a place; it felt like an encounter with something eternal.
