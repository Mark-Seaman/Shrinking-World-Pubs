# Sharing the Love of God

by Jacque Pegg

---

Taking in all the experiences was overwhelming. Paul's journey is truly astonishing—how he managed such a feat is beyond
comprehension. His unwavering love for Jesus and relentless commitment to spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles is deeply
inspiring. Despite enduring tremendous suffering, he praised God through every trial. 

Listening to Mark’s teachings in
the very places where Paul once spoke brought a powerful and heartfelt connection. It was as if the past came alive,
allowing me to envision those early believers, some of the first Gentiles to embrace the Christian faith, gathering and
listening with hope in their eyes. 

The atmosphere in those places was almost tangible; I felt surrounded by history, faith, and resilience. To imagine
Paul’s voice echoing across those ancient streets, calling people to faith, gave me chills. It was a rare, moving
privilege to step into a space where such profound moments of faith unfolded. 

Realizing I stood on ground that was
central to the birth of Gentile Christianity was humbling beyond words. The entire experience left me reflecting deeply
on the strength of conviction, the power of faith, and the incredible story of a man driven by love to transform lives.
