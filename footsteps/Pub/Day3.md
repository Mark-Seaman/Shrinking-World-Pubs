## Philippi / Kavala 

Today we tour along the ancient route of the apostle Paul to Amphipolis (Acts 17:1). Our journey takes us to ancient
Philippi, which was named after the father of Alexander the Great. This busy Roman colony boasted a great library and
theater. In Philippi, Paul preached and established the first church in Europe, and it was the people of Philippi to
whom he wrote one of his epistles while imprisoned in Rome (Acts 16:11-40; Philippians). It was in this area that Paul
met Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She and her household accepted Christ and were baptized in the nearby river (Acts
16:11- 15). Next we continue to Kavala, ancient port of Neapolis (Acts 16:9-11). We return to our hotel in Thessaloniki
for dinner and overnight.
