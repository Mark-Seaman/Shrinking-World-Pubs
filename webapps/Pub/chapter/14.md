### Overview

This chapter will explore the best practices of software engineering. When programmers
first start their career they focus entirely on the art of programming. This involves
writing code and debugging and testing it. The initial challenge of development is to 
create code reliably and productively.

All developers soon realize that this is not enough to succeed as an engineer. There are
a lot of skills that are required beyond writing code. There is an entire field of software
engineering that deals with the process of how to develop software. While learning the key
technologies is important, it is also critical to master the disciplines of engineering.


### Design Patterns

The practices of software engineering are built on several major concepts that will be
explored in detail in this chapter.  Three areas warrant special
consideration. We will explore each of these and recommend some beneficial practices.

### Software Lifecycle

Every software project will progress through a series of phases. During each phase, the developers
must take on a different mindset to deal with the unique decisions that must be made to make
progress.  

The four main development phases of any project are:

* **Requirements** - understand the business and technical requirement
* **Design** - create a plan for how the solution will use the technology
* **Code** - implement the code with all of its features
* **Test** - ensure that the code works under all conditions


### Waterfall Lifecycle

Thirty years ago the practices of engineering were defined by the conceptual model of
the Waterfall Software Lifecycle. This model teaches that each phase of the lifecycle 
should be completed before proceeding to the next. Once a plan was put in place there 
was tremendous resistance to changing the plan.

Project failure was common as teams refused to adapt to new knowledge discovered as the
project progressed. The most important decisions were made with the least amount of 
knowledge and then cast in concrete. This was particularly true of the early phases, 
Requirements and Design. Massive project plans were created and adhered to blindly. As a 
result, many projects (as high as 50%) failed to deliver on the primary business goals 
(schedule, features, cost) by release.

In 2001 a group of software practitioners (each promoting their own methodologies) decided
to pool their efforts and develop a standard alternative that could be used by everyone.
This became known as the Agile Software process and it is now recognized as the only reasonable 
way to develop software.


### Agile Manifesto

**Values of Agile Software**

* Individuals and interactions more important than processes and tools
* Working software more important than comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration more important than contract negotiation
* Responding to change is more important than following a plan


**Principles behind the Agile Manifesto**

We follow these principles:

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference for the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention is given to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work that is unnecessary--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.


### The New Lifecycle

The phases of the Waterfall Lifecycle were believed to be serial activities.
While the phases of development remain the same (Requirements, Design, Code,
Test) with Agile Software development they are seen as overlapping activities.

The activities and focus remain the same. What is different is that the next
phase will produce knowledge that will change the current phase of focus.
Feedback is given to earlier phases and changes are made. For example: while
coding in the design phase, problems are discovered that require changing the 
initial designs. Sometimes there are even features that are added or removed
during coding that forces a new plan of the requirements.

Being agile means being flexible. Everything is flexible: requirements, design,
code, tests, deployment. The world is constantly changing, so our software
must be aware of this change and take advantage of the growing knowledge. This
brings us to the next important concept.


### Incremental Development

Traditionally software projects were done as one big lump. Many developers
would work on the code and progress would occur in many areas at once. Late
in the project, all of the parts would be integrated together and testing
would be performed. This phase of the project was typically a nightmare with
all of the incompatibilities and debugging requiring weeks or months 
to resolve.

Fortunately, this is now recognized as engineering malpractice. Now developers
are expected to work on one feature at a time and make steady progress
throughout the project, rather than following a process that will naturally lead 
to a time of mass panic requiring superhuman effort in order to achieve a somewhat 
stable code release.

To complete a feature requires that it experience the full set of activities
within the lifecycle: Requirements, Design, Code, Test. It also requires that
every feature be integrated into the system before moving on. This totally
eliminates a panic phase during testing that was so typical of projects before 
Agile Software.


### Linear progress

If a project is done correctly, it requires consistent effort is applied
throughout development to produce constant progress. While the entire system will undergo
the focused activities, each feature also will move through these same
activities. Feedback from every part of the work is taken into account
by adjusting the project plans and expectations.


### Milestones

Milestones should be defined to mark the overall progress of the project. The
milestone should have objective criteria that reflect the tangible progress
of work accomplished. Never change the criteria.

You need at least four milestones for any size project to cover each of the 
main phases. While no task is ever totally done, there is a point where the
area of focus has become stable and ready to move to the next phase.

Here are a few Milestones you can start with.

* Requirements Complete
* Design Complete
* Code Complete
* Test Complete

For larger projects, you will need to define more milestones to mark your progress. You should not
have more than eight because that introduces too much overhead for the project.


### Proficiency

Skills take time and practice. Utilizing great resources speeds up learning but true 
expertise takes a big investment in both time and energy.

How long does it take to learn a new technology?

The Dreyfus Model (Google it for more detail) offers the best explanation of how knowledge and
effectiveness grow over time. This model applies to knowledge domains that are sufficiently
complex to require years of learning to acquire expert-level status. The graph shown above is based on the
Dreyfus Model but seeks to quantify the learning investment required to reach each level. Some may
quibble with the exact amounts of time but the overall trends match real-world observations.

The model has five levels of proficiency. I've removed the Novice level since it provides no real
measurement. Each stage represents a plateau of understanding and behavior that can last for a long
time. By investing time and energy, an individual is able to experiment with the technology and
eventually achieve a breakthrough. When a person reaches the next level, things stabilize for a
while. Later levels require roughly ten times the investment of the previous level.

**Beginner** - This level of understanding can be achieved in about 10 hours of diligent practice.
  At this stage, a cookbook of actions is required to achieve success. This level is marked by a
  lot of mistakes and close supervision is required to stay on track.

**Competent** - This level of understanding can be achieved in about 100 hours of diligent practice.
  During this stage, the individual has mastered all of the basic concepts and can produce the
  desired results. Productivity may be low and unexpected things may cause the person to struggle.

**Proficient** - This level of understanding can be achieved in about 1,000 hours of diligent
  practice. This stage is characterized by perceiving the true complexity in every situation for
  the first time.  A deeper understanding of root causes allows this person to apply knowledge to
  any new problem.  Past experience lets them troubleshoot problems quickly and with little
  effort.

**Expert** - This level of understanding can be achieved in about 10,000 hours of diligent practice.
  An expert is the leader in a field and has the equivalent of a PhD-level understanding of the
  domain. They work intuitively and effortlessly. When asked, they often can't explain how they
  make decisions, because they have arrived at a level of intuitive and automatic response.
