### Web Hosting Technology

Running a web application on the internet requires many layers of software and
hardware. All of these layers must be properly integrated and working properly
before the application server can answer a single request.

In 1995 the internet was in its infancy and engineers were required to spend a
lot of time worrying about how to get their application hosted before they could
write any business logic. Here's an example of that prep.

* Hardware
* Operating System
* Operational Scripts for server maintenance
* Computer languages and runtime environments
* Frameworks and libraries
* Database services
* Static Web services (NGINX)
* Application Servers (Apache, Gunicorn)
* Application Business Logic


### Virtual Machines

Application developers used to host their own hardware and software in their own
data centers and maintaining all of the networking hardware too. It often proved to be a 
much larger task than the development of the application software.

The first breakthrough occurred with the creation of the Virtual Machine concept and
the Linux operating system. This allowed engineers to have much larger
machines that were all running Virtual Machines (VMs) functioning as stand-alone computers. Linux was free to use and provided an operating system environment
to run the software on the VMs.

This concept of virtualization emerged in the mid-1990s and drove the DotCom Boom
(1995-2000). By 2000 Amazon Web Services (AWS) had established itself as the
king of Virtual Machine hosting. Now engineers could forgo building computer
systems in favor of using AWS to provide the computer server hardware and 
software.

Soon there were many other players competing to provide similar services. These solutions 
were inexpensive compared to the complexity and cost of hosting 
your own hardware. Eventually, this became the standard approach that everyone 
embraced.


### Hosting Web Pages

Hosting static web servers is much easier than hosting dynamic web servers. 
Static web servers don't perform any business
logic on an incoming HTTP request. They are simply a lookup service that
returns an HTTP response corresponding to each HTTP request.

Very cheap services (less than $5/month) have become common and allow businesses 
to have simple websites advertising their companies and products and providing static information.

WordPress software is now running on two-thirds of the active servers
on the internet. Customers can buy an account at WordPress.com and have a blog
running in a few minutes without ever having to deal with any hosting issues.
Leasing existing software running
on existing servers is always your first option for controlling complexity and
cost.


### Extending Static Pages

But, what if you need more? What if you need to host custom
applications?

A simple solution is a static web page that can reference other computer systems 
which can give a static
page dynamic capability. This is done through JavaScript logic that is embedded
in the pages.  This code is sent to the client web browser and executed by the
web browser (not on the server).

By 2000 many new applications were running with heavy JavaScript payloads that
provided dynamic capability while running on a static web server.
This led to our current reality, characterized by:
* Server-side logic is referred to as Back-end Development (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript)
* Client-side logic is referred to as Front-end Development (JavaScript)
* Full-stack Developers work on both sides 

To build a fully custom app, we can choose between a balance of Server-side
or Client-side development.  Powerful frameworks have emerged on both sides to 
make development easier.

* Server Frameworks
    * Node JS (written in JavaScript)
    * .Net Framework (Written in C#)
    * Rails (written in Ruby)
    * Laravel (written in PHP)
    * Django (written in Python)
* Client Frameworks
    * Vue.js (written in JavaScript)
    * React (written in JavaScript)
    * Angular (written in JavaScript)

All of these frameworks are powerful and capable of producing good results but
they all have steep learning curves. Pick one and become an expert. If you 
invest in several, you will spread yourself too thin and never achieve the 
competency that makes you competitive in the workplace.


### Hosting Provider

A major reason that developers choose to minimize back-end development is that
it requires the Application Hosting provider to support certain capabilities.
Depending on the provider, this can be a big deal.

We have seen radical improvements to this situation in the last few years. We now have
excellent solutions that are easy to set up and require no ongoing maintenance.

Ten years ago hosting a web application server running Django
would require you to spend many hours setting up and maintaining all aspects
of your platform infrastructure. Consider the following scenario:

* AWS account services 
* Virtual Machine setup
* Domain registration and DNS routing
* Linux (Ubuntu 2022.04 LTS)
* Python (version 3.10.4)
* Django (version 4.0.4)
* SSL certificate and renewal

Not only is there a lot to do to keep the system running but there is a lot 
to learn. Developers often spent hundreds of hours trying to get the server 
infrastructure running. It was hard to get going and hard to keep it running
properly. DevOps emerged as a full-time job, existing between development and operations.


### Docker

Docker introduced the notion of a Container in 2015 that would simplify the
installation and maintenance of application components.
Similar to a Virtual Machine, Docker Containers can capture an entire ecosystem
that can be loaded into memory or stored as needed.

Many web hosting companies soon adopted Docker containers as a way of getting system
components up and running quickly. But the task to maintain the 
service infrastructure still remained.


### Digital Ocean

Digital Ocean emerged as an early leader for hosting Django applications.  
They greatly simplified the process of getting the code running for developers.

Building your hosted app at AWS or Google App Engine involved building all of the components 
starting with the Virtual Machine, Operating System, Python, Django, Postgres, 
DNS routing, SSL registration and renewal. There were many services that were
offered (often with additional fees). The ultimate cost of operations was
sometimes staggering.

Configuring web hosting at Digital Ocean involved creating a Droplet (based
on Docker Container). This Droplet contained all the platform infrastructure that
was required to run a Django application. 

Now it was finally possible to create a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment
to host a Django application in hours, not days. The engineer is still in full
control of all of the details of each layer of the infrastructure and can tweak
anything in the stack.

* Operating System
* Python 3.10
* Django 
* MySQL database
* Droplets
* Docker containers


### App Platform

In 2019 Digital Ocean introduced another giant leap forward. App Platform is
built on top of the Droplet technology and understands the type of application
that you are trying to deploy.  It does all of the application set up for you
automatically and provides ongoing management of all your infrastructure.

It supports all of the major types of apps with new ones introduced regularly.

* Node JS 
* .Net Framework 
* Rails 
* Laravel 
* Django
* Vue.js
* React
* Angular

App Platform provides a GUI to build your server platform. You interactively 
select your choices and it builds and deploys what you need to run your app.
Now application deployment can be done in minutes, not hours.

Automatic maintenance of platform includes: Operating System, Python, Package
Libraries, and Database. You can even point domains at the app and get an SSL
certificate automatically registered.

Each time you commit changes to your Github account, the application environment
is completely rebuilt on the server from scratch. If it fails, the last
good version is redeployed so your app keeps running, even if you push bad code.


### App Platform Costs

At the time of this writing, you can register for a new account at Digital 
Ocean and get a $100 credit. Service costs are extremely low, without add-on fees. Other hosting providers seem to have a lot of hidden costs.

* Static Server - Free
* Django App - $5/month  
* Database - $7/month

The rest of this book will assume that you are using App Platform at Digital
Ocean. Of course, you are free to use any web hosting service that you choose.
This textbook will provide simple instructions for getting your server up and
running.


### Django App Hosting

Next, we must learn to deploy an application that is already running successfully
on our local computer.

Configuring a top-level Django application at App Platform requires several
activities.

* App Platform application
* Django App Server
* Static Asset Server
* Database Server

We will look at each of these, one at a time, to ensure that the application
is fully configured and operational.



### Static Web Server

Before any of our work goes public we must set up the server infrastructure
at our service provider. We will be using Digital Ocean for this book since
it is easy to get up and running quickly while giving us the ability to scale
later.

The first step in deployment is to build a static website that is live on the
internet at Digital Ocean. This web server will answer HTTP requests and produce HTTP responses.
It will provide a direct mapping from request to response but will not execute
any custom business logic or handle data.

Static servers will handle files of many types: Images, Videos, CSS, HTML,
JavaScript. Our Django Application will use a static web server to handle 
all of the static assets in a secure manner.

A static server will receive HTTP requests and look up the appropriate file
or files to
return as an HTTP response. No interesting business logic is performed by
the server. Static servers may support many types of files.

* HTML files
* JavaScript files (which run on client)
* Images
* Video

### Single Page Apps

Many of these files may contain code that will execute inside the client web
browser. All modern web browsers contain a JavaScript engine for executing the
front-end code. Complex applications can be created by using a JavaScript Front-end Framework 
(such as Angular, Vue, or React).

These apps can be deployed as static websites and Digital Ocean provides free
static websites for deployment. This may be of interest for certain types of 
applications.


### Static Site Generators

Sometimes sophisticated processing is required to create a set of web assets that
can become static when served. A static site generator can be used to 
perform the initial business logic including access to data and invoking other
computers. All of this work is built into a website or collection of assets
that can be delivered to the clients through a static web server.

If you are interested in this topic consider learning about Gatsby, Hugo, and
Jekyll. Building a static site using one of these apps can greatly speed up
the delivery of content. Digital Ocean also provides free static websites for 
deployment.


### Content Delivery Network

A static web server is essentially a lookup service. When an HTTP request is 
received, a suitable HTTP response is created and returned. A given request will
always be answered with the same response. This makes it possible to cache the
responses in either the server or the client. Instead of looking up the file,
a known response is automatically found in the cache and used.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used by Digital Ocean to implement the
static web server. This has built-in caching to speed up the responses and
reduce the computation that is required. The CDN is extremely fast at answering
requests.
