### Applications = Data + Views + Tests

Applications are built by designing and implementing a collection of data
models and the views that interact with the data. This requires you to first
think through the data that exists within your system. This data can be 
captured at a very high level and then turned into running code quite quickly.

The views within the application present data in a user-friendly way and let
the users modify the data in accordance with the business rules of the 
application. These rules are embodied in logic that exists in the views code
as well as the data code.

Applications tend to be built in layers where there are separate concerns for
each layer. An often overlooked part of the application is the testing layer.
Django provides a lot of infrastructure support for testing. Your code will
break as you make changes - it's a certainty! Automated testing guarantee that you will 
know immediately when something is not working correctly.

Building a robust application requires building up all three of these areas
at the same time. The development should proceed by working on a single 
feature at a time. Don't move to the next feature until you have created the
required data, views, and tests.

Minimizing the work in progress at any given time minimizes the risk that something will be
overlooked and require attention later. Maintain the discipline to focus on a
single task at a time.

Static websites can be thought of as views without data. The design of a 
static site is similar to the presentation layer for a dynamic application.


### Database

A relational database is a collection of data tables that hold records of a
particular type. The records in one table may contain pointers to records in
other tables within the database.

Each table is organized in Rows and Columns. Each row represents an Item or 
Record of a particular type. Each Column represents an Attribute of the Item 
or Field of the record.

Queries are performed on the database to access or modify the records. These
queries are written in the SQL programming language. Django provides tools
for letting programmers do SQL queries by interacting with Python objects and
classes.

Under the hood, actual SQL statements are executed but the coder doesn't need
to worry about the formation of the query strings or the database connection.
This makes programming the data layer far more productive than working directly with the
SQL code would allow.


### CRUD Operations

There are four basic operations that are required on every record in the 
database. Some operations may not be needed, but it is good to think about
whether it is needed for your data.

* CREATE - make a new record (Add)
* READ - get one or more records (List, Detail)
* UPDATE - modify an existing record (Edit)
* DELETE - remove a record (Delete)


### Object Relational Mapper (ORM)

Django lets you define the record structure as Python classes that inherit
from a Model class. These classes are used to create the initial database
tables and also to maintain them to reflect changes over time. 

By using these classes you can perform all the necessary CRUD operations on
the data without writing any SQL code. Building the data layer of the 
application involves designing the data structure, coding the data models, and
then implementing the CRUD operations that match the business rules.

There are two views of the same data:  1. Data is records in the database, 2. Data
is Instances of Objects in memory of a specific Model Class. A Django developer
can easily move back and forth between these two concepts.

Define your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic 
database-access API for free â€” but you can still write SQL if needed.

A Django data model is the single, definitive source of information about your 
data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing. 
Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

Create Python Classes to define the structure of the data records and then
use the database migration tool to create SQL tables that match the classes.

Automatically create Database Tables from the models in your application 
with a single command.

    $ python manage.py migrate


### Update the Database

When you change your models you need to update the database tables to
reflect the changes.  Use "makemigrations" to capture the changes needed and
"migrate" to apply the changes to the tables.

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate


The ORM will scan each "app" in your project to find all the data models. Then
each model will be compared to the table structure in the database. If changes
are needed then a "migration" file will contain the SQL required to update
the tables to match the models.

These changes are applied by running "migrate" to automatically update
the database tables.


### Operations on Every Model

Consider our book application. We may need to perform all of these operations
for the Book data type.

* Create Book
* List Books
* Details Book
* Update Book
* Delete Book


### Data Design 

When starting a new application, the most important decisions are related to the
your choice of data models. Choosing an overly complex data model will make your 
whole app complex. Try to build records that store the least amount of data.
By reducing the stored data, your app will be as simple as it can be while still
solving the business problem at hand.

I start with a simple list of the essential attributes for each object. Then 
the data model class will be written to use these fields.


### Example of Data Models

Here's a simple example to learn about working with data. Suppose we want 
to build an application that contains books. We certainly need to 
represent data within the app. Each book will have a title and an author.
As time goes by we will add many other attributes - but our goal is
to always start simply.

Book Data Model

    Book
        Title
        Author


The Python code implements a class that inherits from "django.db.models" and
sets the constraints on the attributes of Book. This class is used to create
a database table called "book__book", which has two fields "title" and "author".
Both of these fields are strings that are limited to 200 characters in length.


### Visit the Django website

The Django website is a great source of information about how Django works.
Visit the page at  https://www.djangoproject.com/start
and read about the "Object Relational Mapper". This is the best source of
info because it is constantly updated and improved.
