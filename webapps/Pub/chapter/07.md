### User Authentication

In order to do certain operations securely, our application must be able
to identify specific users within the app. This is called "User Authentication"
and Django provides extensive support for the process of authentication.

All users will start by registering to use the application. This will create
specific login credentials for each user. Our app will have a registration
page that contains a form for collecting the user name and desired password.

Built-in logic validates the user name and password to ensure that they are
both allowed by the rules of the system.


### Password Encryption

It is critical to security that passwords are always encrypted. This includes
when the information is collected by the form, sent to the server, and stored
on the remote server.

Passwords are hashed and the hash key is stored in the database. When the
user re-enters the password it is rehashed and compared to the stored value.
This protects the password in its raw form. It is impossible to calculate or
look up the actual password and the system guarantees verification that the user
attempting to log in has entered the matching password from registration.

This requires some tricky code that you never want to write from scratch. The primary goal 
is to have a robust implementation that you can trust. The cryptography built
into Django has the highest level of security available.


### User Object

Django provides a data model that is at the heart of the user authentication
scheme. When you create a new application, Django automatically produces 
the code for user authentication. With the first database migration,
it creates all the tables that are required.

    $ python manage.py migrate

You can immediately begin creating users and ensuring that all users must have
permission to access the system.


### Author Objects

Django provides all of the code needed to get a user ID and credentials.
Now we will extend this basic user ID to add other 
information that is specific to our application. The typical web application
has user accounts that correspond to the user IDs for login. There is usually
a profile for each user.

For this discussion, we will create a data model for an Author. This record
will be created when a new User is registered. The only information that is
required to register a new Django user is the "username" and "password". This
information is captured by the Django code inside the UserCreationForm.

When the user first logs in they are shown the settings of their profile which
contain other info that we wish to collect. This allows us to draw a clear
separation between the secure info stored in the User record and the application-specific information stored in the Author record.

Each time an author is logged in we can see the User and corresponding Author
information. This data is used to make decisions about what
each user can do in the application.


### User Login Flow

When users log in to the app the credentials are verified to make sure that
the login is permitted.  The browser then remembers the login info until the
browser window is closed or the user logs out.

This means that as the user visits many pages on the site they are only 
required to log in once.  It is also possible to implement an automatic logout
after a certain amount of idle time.

To create a login view we must define a template and URL route that binds to 
the view code within Django.  We will start by defining a simple template in
the location that Django will automatically find.


### User Authorization

Authentication guarantees the identity of each user. Authorization determines
what permissions the user is allowed to have. Authentication is a prerequisite
to restricting access. 

We can limit access to every page on our system. Some users may be permitted
to view or modify a specific page. The tools make it easy to limit access
in any way that seems appropriate.
