### Overview

Throughout this textbook, we have focused on technology. What are the design
patterns for building the components of the apps? Now we will shift
our attention to the process of building apps. What practices
should be used to implement any project?

To develop software we must understand not only the technology involved but
the process for defining, designing, implementing, and testing the code. This
chapter will look at how to build software effectively. 

Begin by defining a standard process for software development and use it on each new
project. Every project requires at least four different mindsets/phases. Each programmer 
tends to be strong in some areas and weak in others and they focus on
the part of the process they enjoy. Develop the discipline to do all aspects
of the software project well and your professional life will be much more successful 
and easier. Here are the four major phases of a project.

* Gather requirements for the problem
* Design the solution
* Implement the solution
* Test the solution



### Gathering Requirements

At the start of every project, you must understand the business goals before you
can understand the technical goals. There are three fundamental
tradeoffs that must be prioritized on each project. You must know the relative
importance to the client. Most projects have the following order of priorities.

* Schedule
* Functionality/Quality
* Cost

Always divide up the work into milestones that are roughly equal in the amount
of effort required. This allows you to measure your progress
against expectations. This one practice allows you to make adjustments
to stay on track and avoid sliding into major issues with the schedule, 
functionality, or cost.

Our goal is to make steady linear progress throughout the project.  We must
avoid overly optimistic scheduling that will require superhuman effort at some point in the project.
If we are not meeting expectations we want to know sooner rather than later.

The client must be a key part of the project. A weekly review session will
reveal any disconnects and misunderstandings. Make this a required part of 
every project. Demonstrate the weekly progress and ask for feedback. Then
adjust the project based on the feedback.


### Initial Design

Choose the best tools for the project.  Django is a
nice tool for a wide variety of web apps, but if you can find a product that 
already solves the customer's needs you may be able to avoid writing
any code at all. The cheapest software you can deliver is the software you don't 
have to write.

The most important design decision is the choice of tools to build your
solution upon. Give careful thought to this choice because all tools have a learning
curve. If you already know a tool well then you have already paid this price of mastery.
If not, you will need to pay for the learning as you go and it is often significantly
more work than you expect.

Learning new tools is about learning specific tricks. Each trick takes about
a day to learn because you must find all of the ways it won't work. Once you
know a trick well you can do it in an hour. A web app has about 50 tricks that
you must know. This translates into 50 days or 50 hours depending on how
many new tricks you must master.

Throughout the project, track the unsolved problems. Anything that seems difficult
is pointing to a new trick that must be learned. This list will help
you estimate how quickly you are resolving the new problems as they emerge.

Build core functionality first. This will prove out the basic design as 
quickly as possible. Build prototypes as proof of concept.
Tackle the most difficult design challenges first.


### Design as You Go

Your first design will need to change because when you start a new project your 
understanding is very incomplete. As your knowledge grows, your designs must
adapt to the new understanding of reality.

Once you start writing code, changing the design can be very disruptive. 
Many people are tempted to avoid changing the code as much as possible. This
creates the problem of the code logic becoming outdated with the requirements
and the design.

A core competency of engineers is learning how to change the code without 
breaking the functionality. This practice is called **refactoring** and is the
most important skill of design.

Refactoring is about changing the design without breaking the functioning code features.
Refactoring allows the code to improve and adapt over time.
This is the opposite of the natural tendency for the code to decay.

Refactoring requires that you have tests in place to make sure that the
functionality remains the same. The goal of refactoring is to change the 
structure and design of the code without affecting the features at all.


### Balance Coding Tasks

The implementation phases of software development require several different mindsets.
Balancing these tasks during coding is important. It is easy to concentrate
on creating features and neglecting the unseen parts of the project.

Each day should have a balance of the following.

* **Test** - Build test code to ensure that every feature you write works properly.
Test code should account for half of the code you write.
* **Fix** - When you test you will find issues. Fix them immediately before doing
anything else. What you see may be the only symptom you see of a major flaw.
* **Extend** - Adding new features is the part of coding that both developers and
clients appreciate. It is highly visible and naturally draws our attention.
The challenge is to fully appreciate the other parts of coding.
* **Improve** - Refactoring is what keeps the code fresh. Improving the design
and structure of the code is the most frequently neglected part of the coding
process, but you won't get very far unless the design adapts over time.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This process is very counter-intuitive and difficult for many to accept. But once you get the hang
of it you will consider it an essential technique for coding.

TDD starts by selecting one simple feature. What is the simplest test that would indicate that the
feature is not working? Write the failing test. This verifies that your actual test is good. Try to
write one line of Python code to check for one simple thing.

Then write enough code to pass the failing test. Try to write one line of code that passes the test.
Hard-code everything at first and fix it later. Duplicate code at first and refactor it later. Make
it specific now and generalize it later.

Refactor the code to fix all of the quirks that you just created. You have tests - you have features
that work. Now fix the structure. Remove duplication. If it feels clunky then it is. Generalize to
simplify, add abstraction without changing the behavior. Work until this one area is perfect in
functionality and design.

Now that feature is done. Select a new feature and repeat until done. This is the beauty of TDD. It
is simple and effective and lets you build with amazing speed and quality.


### Summary of Development Loop

* Select one feature
    * Setup an automatic test that fails
    * Write code to fix the test
    * Commit changes

There are two ways that you can measure TDD effectiveness. First, measure the
number of loops (features) that you can code in an hour. With practice, you
should be able to do about 60 loops in an hour.  

Another measure of TDD is comparing the lines of test code with the lines of
product code. If you are doing true TDD, the test code will be the same size
as the product code.



### Build out all layers

Our apps have several different layers. Each of these layers requires a 
somewhat unique mindset.

* **App** - The app layer deals with the overall project structure.  This 
includes the web hosting infrastructure, settings, URLs, views, templates,
and database connection.
* **Data** - This revolves around the data models and how the views interact
with the records in the database.
* **Views** - This involves the pages which require URLs, views, and template
code to be written.
* **Tests** - The Django test infrastructure should be used to create Page tests,
Data tests, and Views tests to cover all of the product code that we write.
