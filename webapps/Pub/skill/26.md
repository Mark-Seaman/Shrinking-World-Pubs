## Skill 26 - Simple Views



### Step 1 - Build with Card Views

Using cards defined in Bootstrap gives your app a very nice appearance.  
Responsive design is a must in any modern web application.


**views.py**

    class CardView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'card.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            title = "Gettysburg"
            body = 'Four score and seven years ago ...'
            return dict(title=title, body=body, color='bg-primary', width='col')


**templates/card.html**

    <div class="{{ width }}">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header {{ color }}">
                <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body text-dark p-5">
                {{ body }}
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>



### Step 2 - Build with Multi-column Layout

Container

* Add container to give better layout to any view
* Wrap the main content in a container

Grid Layout 

* Add "row" and "col"
* A row will fit items horizontally
* Start with equal width
* templates/workshop.html

Responsive Columns

* Use class "col-lg-4, col-lg-8"
* Color the first column
* Test the response to resizing the view



### Step 3 - Build with Nested Views

Card Layout

* Use class "col-lg-6" for half width
* Test the response to resizing the view
* Unequal sizes that also stack vertically

Multiple Card Layout

* Use class "col-lg-6" for half width
* Iterate over all cards
* templates/workshop.html

Columns of Cards

* Pass in a list of columns
* Each column is a list of cards
* templates/workshop.html


**views.py**

    class CardsView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'cards.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return dict(cards=cards_data())


**templates/cards.html**
  
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">

            {% for card in cards %}
                {% include 'card.html' %}
            {% endfor %}

        </div>
    </div>



### Step 4 - Display Markdown Documents

**views.py**

    class DocumentView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'document.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            document = self.kwargs.get('doc')
            path = Path('Documents')/document
            markdown_text = markdown(path.read_text())
            return dict(text=markdown_text)


**templates/document.html**

    {% extends 'theme.html' %}

    {% block title %}Page Title{% endblock title %}


    {% block content %}

        {% autoescape off %}
        <p>{{ text }}</p>
        {% endautoescape %}

    </div>
    {% endblock content %}


**urls.py**

    urlpatterns = [

        path('doc/<str:doc>', DocumentView.as_view()),
    ]


Matching URL:  **http://localhost:8000/doc/README.md**



### Step 5 - Display Table from CSV

To read a table from a file and display the result as an HTML table is quite
easy.  We can read a CSV file with a single line of code, by opening the file
and getting the rows with a CSV reader. Each row is just a list.  The view
iterates over the rows and columns and converts the table into "tr" and "td"
elements in HTML.

**templates**

    <table>
        {% for row in table %}
        <tr>
            {% for column in row %}
            <td>
                {{ column }}
            </td>
            {% endfor %}
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>

**views.py**

    from csv import reader

    class TableView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'table.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            table = reader(open('Documents/lessons.csv'))
            return dict(title='Lessons Schedule',
                        table=table)



### Step 6 - Display Html Static Pages

Sometimes you will just need to build a static website within a Django 
application.  If the entire site is static then it is easiest to build a
static web server to host your website online.  But there are occasions that
call for a large amount of static content mixed with dynamically generated
content.

To serve static pages you must need to place them in your static server (in
our case the "static" directory).  But what if you would like use the features
of the Django template engine to make your job easier.

There are several features that can be used while minimizing the Python code
created.  You may want to consider these features that Django offers when 
you don't need a database or other fancy logic.

* **View Inheritance** - It is very easy to write cascading HTML files that remove
duplicate HTML code.
* **Server-side Includes** - Using partial templates makes your HTML code readable
by humans.
* **Partial templates** - The ability to name chunks of HTML and abstract the 
details is powerful when all your logic is in HTML.
* **Block Substitution** - Another way to abstract the concepts in your code
for readability.

This simple static web server can be implemented in just a few lines of code.
Each URL that ends in HTML is thought to be a template with the same name.
The template loader find the matching template and runs it through the 
Django template engine to produce the proper HTML.


**templates**

    index.html
    page1.html
    page2.html


**views.py**

    class PageView(TemplateView):

        def get_template_names(self):
            page = self.kwargs.get('page', 'index')
            return f'{page}.html'


**urls.py**

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<str:page>.html', PageView.as_view()),
    ]


In Chapter 12 we will build a complete static website from a dynamic Django app.  These pages can
then be viewed inside of another application by using the trick described here.  This may be useful
when you get HTML files already built that need to be used as a part of your new project.
