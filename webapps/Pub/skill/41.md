## Skill 41 - Planning Grid

### Step 1 - Create a Planning Grid

In the early phases of a project
the main emphasis is placed on gathering the requirements. But there are also other areas that 
require attention. For example, this is the time to select the key technology that will be used and
begin working on prototype tools and code, and test planning.

In fact, each milestone requires all of the development roles to be active. Imagine a planning grid
that contains the milestones as rows and the dev roles as columns. This lets you define your milestones 
and roles for your lifecycle within a spreadsheet. Simply doing this will cause you to think about 
the progress on your project in a more holistic way.

Do lightweight planning and update your plans with each milestone. Track your progress and measure
the rate throughout the project. Make adjustments early to stay on track.


### Step 2 - Add a Project Planner

Once you have the planning grid you can implement a single page that lets you record notes that are
tied to each cell in the table. See Demo 14 for the file named "Project Planner.md".  It is a
simple Markdown file that can be added to a Github repo to provide an index for your project
plan.

Each cell contains a hyperlink that takes you to a Github file that you will create as you go.  With
this simple technique you may set the standard for how to manage projects in your organization.


### Step 3 - Using a Planning Grid

This method draws all of the project planning content into a single place using a uniform format
for managing the project details. It provides enough structure to manage other project details
like User Stories, Epics, Sprints, Product Backlog.

It also provides a top-level view of the entire project as it progresses through the milestones.
Clients love the details combined with the big picture. They can easily feel confident that the
project is progressing at a pace to release on time. This structure will give the clients a much
more detailed insight into the project than is typical.  This is a real trust builder.
