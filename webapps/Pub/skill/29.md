## Skill 29 - Media Hosting


### Step 1 - Configure Settings

Uploaded images are treated by Django as Media assets.  The settings file is configured to handle
the uploads by setting two variables in the "settings.py" file.  This creates a specialized static
server for dealing with the media storage.  

NOTE: This special server only works when the **DEBUG** variable is True. You should not deploy a
Django app with DEBUG enabled. This requires a more complex solution that is beyond the scope of 
this book.  For more information about this see the WhiteNoise documentation at 
http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/django.html.


config/settings.py

    # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/

    # Upload location for images
    MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"

    # Static Files
    STATIC_URL = 'static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']



### Step 2 - Media URLs and Storage

The images for users must be handled differently than the other static media
used by your application. Because users are uploading content, this should be
stored in a location that is isolated from the media assets that are built into
the app.

Django provides an easy way to serve the static media during development.
We will change our app settings to show where the media should be stored.
Then we will modify the URL routes to locate these assets.

When requests are made to view the images they must be served in the same
way as our other static media assets. This requires us handling the URL routes
for the images in **urls.py**.

The MEDIA_URL is added on to the regular list of URL routes. This one line
is all that is needed to serve the media assets.


**urls.py**

    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns = [

        # Photo
        path('photo/',                 PhotoListView.as_view()),
        path('photo/<int:pk>',         PhotoDetailView.as_view()),
        path('photo/add',              PhotoCreateView.as_view()),
        path('photo/<int:pk>/',        PhotoUpdateView.as_view()),
        path('photo/<int:pk>/delete',  PhotoDeleteView.as_view()),

    ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)


Now we are ready to upload user content to the media directory and serve
the media assets.



### Step 3 - List View

Displaying the images requires using the Photo data model. For a list of Photos,
a template can choose the **image** tag and **title** tag to populate the HTML
"img" element.

**templates**

    <ul>
        {% for photo in photos %}
            <li>
            <img src="{{ photo.image }}" alt="{{ photo.title }}">
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>  


The view enumerates the Photo objects for display and passes them to the template. Note that the
view sets up the name for "photos" that is used within the template.

**views.py**

    class PhotoListView(ListView):
        template_name = 'photo/list.html'
        model = Photo
        context_object_name = 'photos'



### Step 4 - Test Image Upload

To test the whole process we start at the add view for photos.  This is invoked by requesting
"http://localhost:8000/photo/add".  This show the form that contains the "ImageField".

Use the "Browse" button to select a file. "Save Image" will upload the image file and save it in
the media folder.  If you have set everything up correctly this will display the uploaded photo.
If not, then you need to retrace your steps and debug the app.
