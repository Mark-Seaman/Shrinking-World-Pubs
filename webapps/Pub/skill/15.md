## Skill 15 - Admin Views


### Step 1 - Enable Admin Views on Book

**book/admin.py**

    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Book

    admin.site.register(Book)


### Step 2 - Test Admin Book

On your development computer execute these commands

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser
    $ python manage.py runserver
    
    browse to 127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

You should see the admin interface of your application. Login using the
passsword for your superuser. This interface will let you interact with the 
User information records built into Django. You can also view and modify the
records for the objects you registered (in this example, Book).



### Step 3 - App Platform Deployment

In order to use the admin views you need to create a superuser on the server.
On App Platform you must do these tasks with each new deployment.

* Migrate the database
* Create a superuser
* Launch the web server

Creating a superuser requires setting two App-level Environment Variables.

    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=seaman
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=**********

When the password is set, choose the Encrypt option. This will prevent anyone
from seeing your actual password. Now you are ready to define the Run Command.


Run Command

    python manage.py migrate --no-input
    python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input --email 'me@here.us'
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi



### Step 4 - Static Assets

The admin interface views use static assets: Images, Stylesheets, and JavaScript
files. These assets are served by a built-in static server when running on your
local machine. For security reasons, on remote servers these must be served
by a static web server (not by our application server).

We already set up a static server to run on our remote web provider. Now we
need to add the assets for the admin interface. The files will be placed into
the "static" directory in our git repo and pushed to the remote server. This
will be used by our static server to serve the images, CSS, and JS files.

The **collectstatic** command can be run on the local machine to extract all
of the files from the Django packages. We will place these files in a static
directory and push the code. Then we need to make a change to the settings file
to direct where the files should be stored.

settings.py

    # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
    STATIC_URL = 'static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']

    # Where to put extracted resources
    STATIC_ROOT = 'static_assets/'


Extract the assets and then move them into the static directory.

    $ python manage.py collectstatic

    $ mv static_assets/admin static
    $ rm -r static_assets

    $ git commit -am 'Static admin assets'


Now your remote Admin Views will be nicely styled. Read the Django documentation
at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/static-files/ for more insight
on Static media files.
