## Skill 39 - DevOps Practices


DevOps is the integration of the Development Cycle (Requirements, Code, Test) with the
Operations cycle (Deployment, Scaling, Monitoring). This results in a combined interaction
that involves all of the key aspects of creating and managing the software.

* Requirements
* Code
* Test
* Deploy
* Scale
* Monitor

Integrating the workflows ensures that everyone stays well-aligned and working on the same
problems.


### Step 1 - Tools

Use appropriate tools and process to match the needs of your project. For a larger project you
should consider the following tools.

* Version Control - Git
* Test Automation - Django Unit Tests
* Continuous Integration - Jenkins
* Monitoring - Nagios
* Machine Configuration - Docker, Kubernetes


### Step 2 - Version control

DevOps cannot be done properly unless everything is located in the version control system.
All of the code and tools to build the code must be committed to Git.  All of the machine
configuration scripts should also be in the version control.

With each new deployment the scripts should construct the entire server environment from scratch.
Otherwise you will never know if everything that is needed is safe and secure.  

Docker scripts should collect all of the packages that are required to build the server machine
images on the production server.  These should be tested with each deployment.


### Step 3 - App Platform

The infrastructure at Digital Ocean supports a DevOps mindset. Studying the demo code will show
that we have been using this approach on every demo throughout this book.
When we commit new code to our Git repo "PythonWebApps", App Platform triggers a build process.
By default this build is set up to 

* Pull new code
* Build all of the Python components and packages
with the correct version of Python
* Configure and provision a new with all the required components
* Create a static web server
* Run the Django web server code
* Connect to the database

All of this happens automatically and is controlled by the **app.yaml** file in the config 
directory.  Changes can be made to the file and uploaded to the server.  This one file
controls the entire DevOps process.

The only thing we are missing is running the automated tests.  This can be added to the Run Command
to ensure that all tests pass before the server is deployed.
