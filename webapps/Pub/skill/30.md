## Skill 30 - Image carousel


### Overview

Bootstrap provides example code for an Image Carousel. This give you an 
excellent way to display images within your application. Bootstrap defines
CSS and JavaScript that runs the carousel to rotate through the images.

Demo 9 and 10 both demonstrate the code that you need to get your Carousel up 
and running in just a few minutes.  All you need is a list of image URLs to pass 
into the view.

Use this code to add a carousel that is based on a list of images.


### Step 1 - Build Template

templates

    <div id="carouselExampleIndicators" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel">

        <div class="carousel-indicators">

            {% for image in carousel %}

                <button type="button" 
                    data-bs-target="#carouselExampleIndicators" 
                    data-bs-slide-to="{{ image.id }}"
                    class="{{ image.active }}" 
                    aria-label="Photo {{ image.id }}" 
                    {{ image.aria }}>
                </button>

            {% endfor %}

        </div>

        <div class="carousel-inner">

            {% for image in carousel %}

                <div class="carousel-item {{ image.active }}">
                    <img class="d-block w-100" src="{{ image.image_url }}" 
                        alt="{{ image.label }}">
                </div>

            {% endfor %}

        </div>
    </div>



### Step 2 - Build View

views.py

    class PhotoCarouselView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'photo/carousel.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            photos = Author.get_me(self.request.user).photos
            return dict(title='Carousel View', carousel=carousel_data(photos))


        def carousel_data(photos):
            return [photo_data(id, photo) for id, photo in enumerate(photos)]


        def photo_data(id, photo):
            x = dict(image_url=f"/media/{photo.image}", 
                     id=str(id), 
                     label=f"Photo {photo.image} {id}")
            if id == 0:
                x.update(active="active", aria='aria-current="true"')
            return x


There are a lot of details here that you must get correct.  If you need to debug this view then
start with some simpler code and build it up a bit at a time.  For example, you could hard-code
links to images that come from the internet.  A great source of free images is Unsplash.  See
Demo 9 for how to use this.

Using images from the internet lets you focus on the Carousel loading without worrying about 
whether your images are loading correctly.
