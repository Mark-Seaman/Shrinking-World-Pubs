### Step 1 - Project Milestones

Every project should be built with clear milestones. The main point of defining Milestones in your
project is to break the development into chunks of work that can be objectively measured. It is
important to define multiple milestones that are roughly equal in cost.

The expected cost of a medium size web app is about 1,000 hours of engineering effort. You must
break this larger projects into smaller deliverables. If you don't then you will imagine that
progress is going far faster than it actually is.  

Milestones must have objective and measurable criteria. This forces reality upon the project and
builds trust with the client. The goal of any project is to complete the work by applying constant
effort throughout the project.

A project that is taking longer than expected will continue to become even later over time. The
milestones prevent delusional optimism that is not anchored in reality.  If the project is running
late then steps must be taken early when there is still a possibility of getting back on track.
Great milestones should alert you to any danger within the first quarter of the project investment.


### Step 2 - Client Review

You should be making measurable progress weekly on your project. Make sure that you have a standing
meeting weekly to review the progress made in the last week. Meeting more often is probably too
much and meeting less often will allow drift in expectations.

Keep the meeting short but make sure you do these things.

* Review the plan
* Demo the code
* Take feedback
* Update the plan

If a project takes 21 weeks and has 7 milestones then you will have 3 client weekly meetings for
every milestone. Make sure to discuss the milestone progress at each weekly meeting.

During this meeting you will review the plan you made last week and show the progress with live
code. The customer will give you feedback on the things that met their expectations and what needs
to change. From the  client's point of view this is essential to reassure them that you will
fulfill their expectations and your commitments.

Together you will create a plan for the next week's work. It's very satisfying to make a plan and
then the next week show that you are right on track.

Don't go dark on your client or you will regret it! This one simple practice will guarantee that you
stay well aligned with your customer.


### Step 3 - Change based on feedback

Every week of engineering will increase knowledge about the problems that you must solve. Every time
you meet with the client you will gain knowledge about their business needs. This is a moving
target so make sure that your plans remain flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs.

The criteria for success will likely change throughout the project and more understanding of the
problem emerges.  It is critical to take this feedback and respond by altering the plans for the
project.  This needs to be an ongoing learning until the very end.

Many project deliver what was promised only to find that this no longer meets the business goals.
A critical examination of the viability of the solution will guarantee the the project is a
resounding success.  This takes a great deal of courage and humility but can make all of the 
difference.
