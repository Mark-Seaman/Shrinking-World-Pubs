## Skill 6 - Deploy to Production Server



### Digital Ocean Settings

The goal while setting up a Development Server is to get something live 
on the internet. Once we have an initial deployment of our application, there
are still many remaining issues that must be solved.

Django provides many advanced features that let you build a production-quality server that is robust and secure. Digital Ocean gives you access to all of these
security features. We will now work to convert our application code to make
it totally secure and also easy to maintain.


### Django App Source Code

When creating a new app the first thing that needs to be defined is the location
of the source code. This is the top level of the Django application that is
being deployed. The directory specified contains the "manage.py" file.

We will set up the App Platform Service to watch a specific Git repo for changes.
When this code changes a new build will be performed. When successful, a new
deployment will launch and the web application server will be restarted.

If anything fails, the previous build is redeployed to guarantee that there
is no downtime. You want a bad build to fail so that it is not deployed.  
You will get a notification of the failure and will be able to troubleshoot the
problem.

Resources

* Git Repo:  your-name/PythonWebApps.git
* Branch: main
* Source Directory: 02/ProfileApp
* Autodeploy


### Static Asset Server

We also need to set up a static server for our static assets.  This will be
part of our default project.  Repeat the steps shown in Skill 4 but set the
static website within the overall project in App Platform.

Create Resource

* Git Repo:  your-name/PythonWebApps.git
* Branch: main
* Source Directory: 02/ProfileApp/static
* HTTP Request Routes: /static
* Output Directory: leave blank


###  Deploy a Production Application Web Server

Moving from development into production forces a new mindset. This is reflected
in the way that the servers are configured. App Platform provides an easy 
transition to more advanced security.

All of the code has already been written and lies within the Django Framework.
The specific features needed can be enabled to handle the new way of doing things.

These new requirements are enabled by variables located in the Django
"settings.py" file.  We will use Shell variables in App Platform to let us config
options, as desired.

The settings file will read these Shell variables to enable features within the 
Django code. This process allows us to control the Django application without having to change
the Python source code. Setting the Environment Variables is done through the
App Platform settings.


### Commit to Deploy

After you create your application, App Platform continues to watch your Github
repo, branch, and path. When the new code changes are committed to this 
code a build process is automatically started.


### Build Process

A configurable build command controls the behavior of the build process.
You can run scripts to organize and prepare the content on both the static 
server and the dynamic application server.

For a Django app, the default command knows how to compile all the code for the
deployment - you don't need to change anything here.


### Run Command

After a successful build, the server is started up. For a static website, this
means moving the content to a CDN. No other action is required in order to
publish the content onto the internet.  

For a Django app, it is important that you migrate the database, collect the
static data, and startup the Gunicorn web server. You need to specify where 
the web server will find the Python application code. Check out Skill #5 for 
details.


### Environment Variables

App Platform uses environment variables to control the build, deployment, and
even the runtime behavior of the application. These values can be set at either
the application or component level. We will set several "App-level Environment 
Variables" that will be accessed by each component.

Add the following key/value pairs

    DEBUG = 1
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOST = .ondigitalocean.app

DEBUG changes the behavior of the hosted application so that it can be easily
debugged. The first thing you will notice is the yellow debug screen that
appears when the application gets an error. Turn on debugging during 
development and turn it off later.

DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC is used to tell the build process not to collect all of 
the static data for hosting on the static server. Later we will change this
behavior but it is OK for now.

Changing a few lines in config/settings.py lets us read and use the values set
in the Environment Variables.

**config/settings.py**

    from os import getenv

    DEBUG = getenv("DEBUG") == "1"

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = getenv("DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS", "127.0.0.1")


### App Settings

Digital Ocean lets you export all of your app settings into a file.

Go to App Platform, Settings tab

Select the App object and find "App Spec".  Click Edit

Click download to save the App Spec in "config/app.yaml".

Now you can deploy all changes by modifying this file and uploading it to
Digital Ocean.  This saves you the hassle of defining each setting individually.

Use "Upload File" in the App Spec view.

Try it out with your code.


### Reconfigure Using App Spec

The App Spec that you just downloaded contains all of the environment and machine configuration
settings for your application on App Platform.    It is possible to edit this file and upload the
whole thing to reconfigure your server.

For the remaining parts of this textbook, we will be using the **app.yaml** file to reconfigure our
server.  All of the demos for each chapter will be deployed on the same server with this technique.
This lets us recycle the server and repurpose it for each new demo rather than creating a new
server each time.

As you move toward production you will need to set up dedicated servers for each project.  But that
is not needed if we are just experimenting with different apps sequentially.  

The App Spec allows us to carefully build the server configuration and then update everything with a
single action. Each of the 14 demo apps within the repo contain a **app.yaml** that is capable of
deploying the demo code. To use these files you will need to modify any variables to customize
them to fit your code.

Go to the code repository for the demo code for this book at
**https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/PythonWebApps**.

Visit the **02/ProfileApp/config/app.yaml** file.  This file contains a complete configuration to
set up a new server at Digital Ocean using App Platform.  Note that all of the demos for this
course can be deployed using this technique.
    


### Database Server

App Platform will connect our application to our database. Later in this textbook, we will configure
a database for our production server. It isn't needed at this time.  The initial files generated by
Django use the development database by default.

For now, we will have Django configure a development database automatically when the code is
deployed. This will work well for testing out our code but every new deployment will create a brand
new database. This will cause all the data to be lost and it will need to be fixed.

In Chapter 5 we will begin working with real data and we will need to create a real database that
persists through the deployment of the application. At that time we will revisit how we connect to the
database.


### Test the Server

Changing the variables will kick off a build cycle. This will take 10 minutes. When it is done visit
the website to see the App running.
