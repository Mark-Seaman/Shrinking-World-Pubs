## Skill 12 - Complex Variables in Views



### Step 1 - Where does the logic go?

Django allows you to define logic in any area that makes sense to you.

* URLs
* Views
* Templates
* Data

Each of these places have different trade-offs.

**URLs** can be set up to match very specific situations. URL patterns are a form of Regular
Expressions that are handy for pattern matching. These can allow you to pass certain types of
information easily. For example, the URL can be used to pass data into the view code. Sometimes
it is a good choice to make very sophisticated URL paths that represent much of the logic within
your app.

**Views** are written in Python and are where I build most of my application logic. The Python
language is easy to read and write and can be refactored to make the code clean and orderly.

**Templates** are written in HTML (with the Django template extensions). While this does allow for
certain operations to be done in the template, this is far from ideal for general purpose
business logic. I limit the template logic to HTML with a few extensions (extends, block,
include, for, if).

**Data** is defined by the Python model classes. These are reflected in the particular database
schema. I often push a lot of logic into the database by creating relationships between data
records.  


Because I prefer to work in Python, most of my logic is defined either within the views or data
models. You will need to experiment with all of these alternatives to find your personal
preference. I recommend spending time trying to embody the business rules in different ways to
determine which suits you best.


### Step 2 - Move From Simple to Complex

The most important mindset throughout development is controlling complexity.
Start simply and only add the minimum amount of complexity required. Once a new feature
is working properly spend time trying to simplify it. Refuse to add features
to the product unless they are absolutely necessary.

As you add code use the metaphor "Crawl, Walk, Run" to start with the simplest
idea that moves in the right direction. Then you can build on top of that
quickly and easily. Continue to implement features and simplify as you go.

For example, imagine we wish to create a photo gallery. We could outline the
following tasks to develop.

* View one specific image
* View one general image
* View a specific list of images
* View a list from a directory
* View images with other info as list of dictionaries



### Step 3 - Use Python to Manipulate View Data 

When creating new views it is best to start by forming the data.
This is easiest to do independent of the website. I typically start with a
function that is simple and can be called for the view data. Consider this
example:

views.py

    class PhotoListView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'photos.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return gallery_view_data()

    def gallery_view_data():
        return dict(photos=['/static/images/chapter-1.jpg'])

Test the code by invoking "gallery_view_data()" directly and stepping through
with a debugger. When that works, execute the view along with the template.
Also notice how simple the code is. Just enough data to feed the template.

    { 
        'photos': ['static/images/chapter-2.jpg']
    }

You can use print statements to show values and get it running without the
views. Notice how easy this is to work with and review.

    { 'photos':
        [
            {
                'caption': None, 
                'file': 'static/images/chapter-2.jpg', 
                'id': 0
            },
            {
                'caption': 'Caption for Photo 1',
                'file': 'static/images/chapter-3.jpg',
                'id': 1
            },
            {
                'caption': None, 
                'file': 'static/images/chapter-1.jpg', 
                'id': 2
            },
        ]
    }

In a real application the data passed into the template is typically quite 
complex. This allows the Python code to do database queries and build highly
nested combinations of lists, dictionaries, and objects. The template code
remains quite simple and is meant to iterate over all of the data and display
the appropriate content. 

Keep your HTML template code simple and build all of the smarts in your views
and models. Python is quite efficient at building business logic, while HTML
is very clunky.
