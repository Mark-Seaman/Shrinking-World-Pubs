## Skill 16 - Data CRUD views



### Step 1 - Create Blog Builder Project

To illustrate how to use the general model views built into Django we will 
create a blogging application. We will start a new Django application that uses 
a database.  

Multiple data types are defined along with the views required to edit all of
the data records. This app has unique user accounts for authors. Each author
is able to create books interactively with no access to the underlying server.
Readers are able to access the articles but can't modify the contents.

All of the code for this demo is located in the Github repo at
[Blog Demo](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/PythonWebApps/tree/main/06).  
Here you will find a greatly simplified implementation of the key concepts.


Build the project or start a new Django app

    $ django-admin startproject config .
    $ python manage.py startapp blog

Modify config/settings.py
   
Configure the settings as in previous chapters

    ALLOWED_HOSTS
    INSTALLED_APPS
    TEMPLATES
    STATICFILES_DIRS


### Step 2 - Define Data Models

We define two models that will be used to create the application. **Blog** will
define a blog to discuss a unique topic. **Article** will hold the content
of a specific posting on the blog.

A blog may have many articles so there is a One-to-Many relationships from Blog
to Article. This is done by using a ForeignKey in the Article class. This
can be read as "Every Article belongs to a Blog".

blog/models.py 

    class Blog(models.Model):

        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        author = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='Abe Lincoln')
        description = models.TextField()

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse_lazy('blog_list')


    class Article (models.Model):

        blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        body = models.TextField()

        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse_lazy('article_list')


### Step 3 - Implement Data CRUD Views

Django defines view classes that let you view and modify records in the database.
These views capture the common logic and use the data model to create the
contents of the view automatically. This saves you from writing a lot of code.



#### Adding Views

When we add a view to a Django app we must create a template, a view class, and
an URL route for the HTTP requests. For each type of view we will practice by
creating the simplest possible logic for the Template, View, and URL. Later we
will follow up by extending the logic to create a fully custom implementation.


#### Templates

Build a theme template for all pages to use. 

    theme.html

Build templates for Article data CRUD (list, detail, add, edit, delete)

    article_add.html
    article_delete.html
    article_detail.html
    article_edit.html
    article_list.html

Build templates for Article data CRUD (list, detail, add, edit, delete)
    
    blog_add.html
    blog_delete.html
    blog_detail.html
    blog_edit.html
    blog_list.html



#### CreateView

Creating new records can be done with the Django class that inherits from
CreateView.

blog/views.py

    class BlogCreateView(CreateView):
        template_name = "blog_add.html"
        model = Blog
        fields = '__all__'


config.urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('add', BlogCreateView.as_view(),  name='blog_add'),
    ]



#### ListView

Listing the records can be done with the Django class that inherits from
ListView.

blog/views.py

    class BlogListView(ListView):
        template_name = 'blog_list.html'
        model = Blog

config.urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', BlogListView.as_view(), name='blog_list'),
    ]



#### DetailView

Reading a single record can be done with the Django class that inherits from
DetailView.

blog/views.py

    class BlogDetailView(DetailView):
        template_name = 'blog_detail.html'
        model = Blog


config.urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>',        BlogDetailView.as_view(),  name='blog_detail'),
    ]



#### UpdateView

Creating new records can be done with the Django class that inherits from
UpdateView.

blog/views.py

    class BlogUpdateView(UpdateView):
        template_name = "blog_edit.html"
        model = Blog
        fields = '__all__'

config.urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>/', BlogUpdateView.as_view(),  name='blog_edit'),
    ]




#### DeleteView

Creating new records can be done with the Django class that inherits from
DeleteView.

    class BlogDeleteView(DeleteView):
        model = Blog
        template_name = 'blog_delete.html'
        success_url = reverse_lazy('blog_list')

config.urls.py

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>/delete', BlogDeleteView.as_view(),  name='blog_delete'),
    ]
