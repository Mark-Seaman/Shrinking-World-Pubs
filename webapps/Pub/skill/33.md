## Skill 33 - Save and Restore Objects


### Overview

It is often necessary to save content from database records or objects within
the app into files. This allows you to reload the data at a later time or
to send it to another computer system. A core skill
is the ability to read objects from a file and save objects to a file.

Built on top of this skill is the ability to export all (or part) 
of the database records to a JSON file. These can be loaded back into the 
system at a later time or loaded into another system to reproduce the database
state.



### Step 1 - Read Objects

**models.py**

    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
        doc_path = models.CharField(max_length=200, default='Documents')
        cover_image = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)

Read JSON objects from a file.

    def read_json(filename):
        path = Path(filename)
        if path.exists():
            return loads(path.read_text())
        return {}



### Step 2 - Write Objects

Write JSON to a file and pretty print for humans.  They data must be 
serializable so we use the following list comprehension to get a list of
all books.

    # Get objects as dictionaries
    data = [b for b in Book.objects.all().values_list()]

    # Write a JSON file
    write_json(filename, data)


    # Pretty Print the file
    def write_json(filename, data):
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            dump(data, f, indent=4)

Resulting file

    [
        [
            1,
            "A Seaman's Journey",
            1,
            "Documents/seamansguide.com/journey",
            0,
            "/static/images/cover-400.png"
        ],
        [
            2,
            "The Leverage Principle",
            1,
            "Documents/seamansguide.com/leverage",
            0,
            "/static/images/Principle.1000.jpg"
        ]
    ]



### Step 3 - Dump Data

Dump all of the records from the Django database as JSON to the terminal 
window.

    $ python manage.py dumpdata


Apply nice printing with an indent level of 4. Save the result in a file
'mydata.json'. This makes it possible for a human to read the JSON code.

    $ python manage.py dumpdata --indent 4 > mydata.json

A subset of the records can also be exported.

    $ python manage.py dumpdata book > bookdata.json



### Step 4 - Load Data

Import all of the objects that were dumped to the file.  Note that this will 
not succeed if the object records have changed in the database.

    $ python manage.py loaddata mydata.json

    $ python manage.py loaddata bookdata.json


Dump and Load allow data to be moved from one database to another. Be careful
how you use this.
