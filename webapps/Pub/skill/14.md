## Skill 14 - List and Detail Views



### Step 1 - Do CRUD Operations in Shell

Django lets you perform Python operations directly using the Django shell.
This gives you direct back-end access to your database. You can perform
data operations without going through your web server.

Launch the Python shell and connect with the database

    $ python manage.py shell


    Python 3.10.3 (main, May  3 2022, 10:33:03) [Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.3)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>> 

Now you can type Python commands and execute them to perform CRUD operations
on your data.

Use the Book Model

    from book.models import Book

Create book record

    Book.objects.create(title="A Seaman's Journey", author="Mark Seaman")

List Books

    Book.objects.all()

    Book.objects.filter(author='Mark Seaman')

Get specific book

    b = Book.objects.get(title="A Seaman's Journey")
    print(b.author, b.name, b.pk)

Update book record

    b = Book.objects.get(title="A Seaman's Journey")
    b.title = "A Seaman's Life"
    b.save()
    
Delete a record
    
    book = Book.objects.get(title="A Seaman's Journey")
    book.delete()



### Step 2 - Build List View

To define a view you must create a template, view, and URL.  Here we use the **ListView** from 
Django which contains the code to query the book records in the database.


**templates/book_list.html**

    {% extends 'book_theme.html' %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>
        <h1>List of My Books</h1>
    </h1>
    <ul>
        {% for book in object_list %}
        <li>
            {{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }} -
            <a href="{{ book.pk }}">{{ book.title }}</a>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endblock content %}


**book/views.py**

    from django.views.generic.list import ListView
    from .models import Book

    class BookView(ListView):
        template_name = 'book_list.html'
        model = Book


**config/urls.py**

    from django.urls import path
    from book.views import BookView

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', BookView.as_view()),
    ]



### Step 3 - Build Detail View

To define a view you must create a template, view, and URL.  Here we use the **DetailView** from 
Django which contains the code to query the specific book record in the database.


**book/views.py**

    from django.views.generic.detail import DetailView
    from .models import Book

    class BookDetailView(DetailView):
        template_name = 'book_detail.html'
        model = Book

**config/urls.py**

```python
    from django.urls import path
    from book.views import BookDetailView

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<int:pk>', BookDetailView.as_view()),
    ]
```

**templates/book_list.html**

    {% extends 'book_theme.html' %}

    {% block content %}
    <h1>Book Details</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Title: {{ object.title }}</li>
        <li>Author: {{ object.author }}</li>
    </ul>
    {% endblock content %}



### Step 4 - Test Your Work

Run a Django Console in a terminal window

    $ python manage.py shell

Create an object

    >>> from book.models import Book
    >>> Book.objects.create(title="Sea Wolf", author="Jack London")

Show in View - Browse to **http://localhost:8000**
