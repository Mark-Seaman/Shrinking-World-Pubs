## Skill 36 - Test Driven-development


During development setup a consistent workflow that balances different activities.

Create a To Do List that identifies work to be done with specific 
items you expect to work on in the next day. Every day you should work on 
different aspects of the development. Many junior developers concentrate 
solely on adding the features of the app and neglect other aspects.

Go for a balanced approach

* Test
* Fix
* Features
* Improve


### Step 1 - Write a test that fails

Test-Driven Development is the most efficient way to code because it prevents
a heavy debugging workload and leaves you with a battery of tests that are executed for years
to come.

During TDD you pick a single small feature to build and test. All focus is 
tied to the one feature until it is fully complete and tested. You commit
code after each iteration so it is impossible to break the system.

For each feature, you will create a small test that fails. Ideally this test
will be two lines of code. Your initial test must fail to demonstrate that
the test itself is detecting the missing feature.

    do_something()
    check_something()


### Step 2 - Write code to pass the test

The next step is to write the minimum code that will get the test to pass.
Ideally this will be a couple lines of code. When the feature works you now
have the feature and a test to ensure that is continues working.  


### Step 3 - Commit the Code

Commit the code you just wrote and go on to the next feature.
