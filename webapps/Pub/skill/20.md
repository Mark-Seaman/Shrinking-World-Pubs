## Skill 20 - User Login


### Step 1 - Create Login View

**templates/registration/login.html**

    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}

        {{ form }}

        <button type="submit">Log In</button>
    </form>


**config/urls.py**

    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import include, path


    urlpatterns = [
        path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    ]


This is all that is required to get started.

If the user visits http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/ they will see the
login view.



### Step 2 -  Author Home View

This code is all that is required to get a new Django "User" record that will
let the users login. When creating an Author record set the "author" field to
match the logged in user.  For each User record that is created the application
will automatically create the corresponding Author record.

The **UserCreationForm** that Django provides will create a User record with
login credentials.  After a successful login the user will be redirected to 
the default view.  If there is no Author record to match the login ID then
one will automatically be created.  This means that at the first login after
registration the app will have a matching Author record that holds specific
application data.

The settings file should be configured to redirect to the UserHomeView which
is the default URL for the website.


**config/settings.py**

    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'

    LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/'


After login go the default URL '/'.  This will either show the user settings
or display the list of articles available to read.  The login status determines
the page to redirect to.

**views.py**

    class UserHomeView(RedirectView):
        def get_redirect_url(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self.request.user.is_anonymous:
                return '/article/'
            return f'/author/{get_me(self.request.user).pk}'

    def get_me(user):
        return Author.objects.get_or_create(user=user)[0]



### Step 3 - Handle Log out

If the user visits **http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/logout** they will be logged
out of the running app and the browser will not be able to provide the login
credentials for any pages that request them.
