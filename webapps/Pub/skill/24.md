## Skill 24 - Writing Page Tests


Simple automated system testing can be achieved in a few minutes and is
virtually maintenance-free until something happens. We will start by using a
simple page fetcher. Once you see the potential with this you may choose to
extend it into something more robust and complete.


### Step 1 - Requests Package

The Python library **requests** lets you call a remote server with an HTTP
requests.  Start by ensuring that requests is installed.

    $ pip install requests


### Step 2 - Fetch Web Pages

Now we can write tests that fetch web pages from a running server.  This can
be a URL to any server.

    requests.get("https://shrinking-world.com")

Or you can hit the development server locally.

    requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8002/book/3")

Notice that the remote web pages may use HTTPS while the local pages will
always be using HTTP.


### Step 3 - Get a Stack of Pages

Start by creating a file that contains a list of URLs to test.

urls.txt

    https://shrinking-world.com
    https://markseaman.org
    http://google.com
    https://apple.com
    
Now read this file and get all the pages.

pagetest.py

    urls = Path('urls.txt').read_text()
    for url in urls.split('\n'):
        if url:
            print(url, get(url))

I have a test that runs regularly that visits a large number of URLs on many
different servers to ensure that the servers are live on the internet.  
Maintaining this test involves nothing more that maintaining a list of URLs.

This basic capability can be extended to look at the page content being returned.  It is quite easy
to examine the response text to look for text patterns or HTML constructs.

This idea can be extended even further to incorporate advanced tools like Selenium, which provides
functions for decomposing the web pages.  Selenium performs remote control of the browser to 
get pages from servers and execute the JavaScript within the browser framework.
Regular expressions may be used to search for specific 
code snippets within the pages.  Go to "https://www.selenium.dev/" to learn more.

Start with the simple page test using "requests" and then scale up to Selenium if needed.
