## Skill 28 - Photo upload


### Step 1 - Data

By adding a ImageField to a data model you can tap into Django's logic for
uploading files to the server.  A function is defined to tell where the image
should be stored when it is uploaded.
The ImageField remembers the "upload_to" function to be used.


**models.py**

    def get_upload(instance, filename):
        return f'images/{filename}'


    class Photo (models.Model):

        author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True, upload_to=get_upload)


### Step 2 - Views

To build an image upload view we define a template and the view code. 
In the form to add or edit the data model, a special mode must be enabled for the
image upload to be successful.  Note the encoding of "multipart/form-data" in
the edit form.


**templates/add.html**

    <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form }}
        <button type="submit">Save Image</button>
    </form>


Nothing special is required for the view code.

**views.py**

    class PhotoCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
        template_name = "photo/add.html"
        model = Photo
        fields = '__all__'
