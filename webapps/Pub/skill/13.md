## Skill 13 - Build Data Models



### Step 1 - Define Data Records

Identify the objects in the application and the fields that must be supported.

Book Data Model

    Book
        Title
        Author



### Step 2 - Create Python Data Model

book/models.py

    from django.db import models

    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        author = models.CharField(max_length=200)



### Step 3 - Update the Database

Create the tables from the data models using Django migrations. The 
**makemigrations** command will build scripts to modify the database and the
**migrate** command will run these scripts to make the changes.

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate



### Step 4 - Define CRUD Operations

To work with data we need to have four basic operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.   These are
often referred to as CRUD. Once the database has been updated to be in sync with our code then we
can perform all of the basic operations on the data. Here is the Python code we use to operate
on the data directly.


Use the Book Model

    from book.models import Book

Create book record

    Book.objects.create(title="A Seaman's Journey", author="Mark Seaman")

List Books

    # List all objects
    Book.objects.all()

    # List specific objects
    Book.objects.filter(author='Mark Seaman')

Get specific book

    # Get one object
    b = Book.objects.get(title="A Seaman's Journey")

    # Show the details
    print(b.pk, b.title, b.author)

Update book record

    # Get the object
    b = Book.objects.get(title="A Seaman's Journey")
    
    # Modify a field
    b.title = "A Seaman's Life"

    # Save the record
    b.save()
    
Delete a record
    
    # Get the object
    book = Book.objects.get(title="A Seaman's Journey")
    
    # Delete it
    book.delete()
