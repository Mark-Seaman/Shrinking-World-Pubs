## Skill 37 - Code Generator

When you do decide to write software you should always start with a solid
application framework like Django, .Net, Rails, or Node. As you build applications
you will discover that you keep repeating the same code many times.  

Eventually you will learn how to capture the key concepts of the reusable parts
of your code. Design Patterns are an important step in this overall process.
Some of your code will be so familiar that you can actually write a program
that writes portions of your software. That is the idea behind a code 
generator.

Consider how you might generate code automatically when the same structures
recur frequently. Create a way to take advantage of this sameness by automatically 
creating the code with a simple script. A code generator is a script that writes code for
you when the writing becomes repetitive.   


### Create a Code Generator

Refer to Demo 13 for the starting point for creating your personal code generator. 
Work through this demo code to understand how to apply it to your next project.

Create a standard approach to scripting

* Project
* Data
* Views
* Test
* Deployment
* Monitoring

Start small and start simple. Don't be tempted to build the glorious thing, just
build a tool for what you need now. Eventually the tool will grow into something
amazing that will be the cornerstone of your development process.


### Step 1 - Create Project

The **django-admin startproject** command is a code generator. By executing 
this one command script you can generate all of the code and app structure for
a well crafted app that does nothing.

From this starting point, you can quickly create app modules that contain groups of
functionality. The settings.py file is set up initially to be loaded with 
many design choices. If you need to change anything you have full access,
but many decision are already made for you, without any effort.


### Step 2 - Create Data Type

Another area that I have found to be extremely useful to automate has to do
with adding a new data model. As you think back over all of the demo apps
that were written for this book you will realize that there are many conventions
used consistently. The code for each demo has identical constructs in many
ways.

Let's exploit this idea by creating a simple code generator that can build 
a new data type with all of the support for views. Demo 13 is just such
a code generator.

Consider the following example for a Book.

**book/models.py**

    class Book(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
        doc_path = models.CharField(max_length=200, default='Documents')

We need to develop views for book with templates, URLs, and view code.

* BookList
* BookDetail
* BookAdd
* BookUpdate
* BookDelete

Each of these views, templates, and URLs are entirely predictable.   In fact,
we should have code ready to go that implements each of these views.

The templates needed are also entirely predictable, although there are usually
some special details that vary for each.

* book/list.html
* book/detail.html
* book/add.html
* book/edit.html
* book/delete.html

And finally the URLs are extremely consistent as a start.  Note how similar 
the Author URLs are to the Book URLs.  Why write this by hand?

**book/urls.py**

    urlpatterns = [

        # Author
        path('author/',                AuthorListView.as_view(),    name='author_list'),
        path('author/<int:pk>',        AuthorDetailView.as_view(),  name='author_detail'),
        path('author/add',             AuthorCreateView.as_view(),  name='author_add'),
        path('author/<int:pk>/',       AuthorUpdateView.as_view(),  name='author_edit'),
        path('author/<int:pk>/delete', AuthorDeleteView.as_view(),  name='author_delete'),

        # Book
        path('book/',                  BookListView.as_view(),    name='book_list'),
        path('book/<int:pk>',          BookDetailView.as_view(),  name='book_detail'),
        path('book/add',               BookCreateView.as_view(),  name='book_add'),
        path('book/<int:pk>/',         BookUpdateView.as_view(),  name='book_edit'),
        path('book/<int:pk>/delete',   BookDeleteView.as_view(),  name='book_delete'),
    ]
