## Skill 19 - User Registration



### Step 1 - Define Application User Data Model

Define an author data model that uses the built-in type for User.  Additional
fields that are specific to our application may be added to the Author record.
For example, "bio" is a field that would hold information about each Author
that is not supported by the built-in data model for User.


**models.py**

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.db import models

    class Author(models.Model):

        user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
        bio = models.TextField()



## Step 2 - Create Sign Up View

The same template that was used for the login form can be used for the sign up
form.  However it is common to want to add different information to the two 
forms, so I recommend that you keep them separate.


**templates/registration/signup.html**

    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}

        {{ form }}

        <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>



**views.py**

    from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

    class SignUpView(CreateView):
        form_class = UserCreationForm
        success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
        template_name = 'registration/signup.html'



**config/urls.py**

    from django.urls import include, path
    from django.views.generic import RedirectView

    urlpatterns = [
        path('accounts/signup/', SignUpView.as_view(), name='signup'),
    ]

After a successful registration the user will be redirected to the login page.
