## Skill 31 - Reading and Writing Tables


### Overview

Working with CSV data is so common that is it a core competency that every
application developer will need to master. Using spreadsheet data involves
being able to read a CSV file, iterate over its contents, and write data to
a CSV file.  

These skills will be presented with the simplest code that will
get a solution immediately. You can always add more logic to do specialized
processing of the data if you need, but start by mastering the basics.

When we work with CSV data we are working with a spreadsheet table. Most apps
you write will have some form of tables to work with.


### Step 1 - Read Table

Python defines a reader that can parse the CSV data.  Call the reader once to get each new
row from a file.


**views.py**

    from csv import reader

    def read_table(path):
        with open(path) as f:
            return [row for row in reader(f)]



### Step 2 - Write Table

Python defines a standard way to write CSV content to a file. 


**views.py**

    from csv import writer

    def write_table(path, table):
        with open(path, 'w', newline='') as f:
            writer(f).writerows(table)



### Step 3 - Print Table

Printing a table is Python is quite easy.  Simply iterate over the rows and columns to print all
the values.

    def print_table(table):
        for row in table:
            print(row[0], row[1], row[2])



### Step 4 - Display Table

Use a template to iterate over all of the rows.  Then iterate over the columns in each row.
The template will emit a **tr** HTML element for each row and a **td** HTML element for each 
column.

**templates**

    <table>
        {% for row in table %}
        <tr>
            {% for column in row %}
            <td>
                {{ column }}
            </td>
            {% endfor %}
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>


**views.py**

    class TableView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'table.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            path = 'numbers.csv'
            return {'table': read_table(path)}
