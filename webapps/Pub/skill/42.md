## Skill 42 - Client Communication


### Leverage the Demo Code

#### Demo 14 - Software Planner

* Fully dynamic website
* Ready to use out of the box
* Customize your milestones, roles, and deliverables
* Allows for developers and client to modify content
* Customize by editing the source code


### Step 1 - Engineering Log

Create a website for interacting with your client. Start with a single page
that contains the key objectives for your project. Let this grow organically
and naturally throughout the project. Beyond the weekly meeting, this is the 
most important thing you can do to promote a healthy customer relationship.

* Each time you have a weekly meeting create notes on this web page that can be
reviewed at any time.
* Keep the information concise but complete. 
* Use hyperlinks to navigate to running code and detailed documentation and other websites.
* Consider giving writing access to your client and developers so that everyone can add
to the knowledge as it is acquired.


### Step 2 - Tracking Progress

Scrum is the agile project management process. It defines a stand-up meeting
where people answer three questions:

1. What did I work on?
2. What will I work on next?
3. What challenges concern me?

These are vital questions that developers should use when interacting with
one another. These are also questions that your client is interested in.
Consider building these into a status page.

For people that work for me and the work I do for others, it is important
to build accountability into the relationship. Offering an ccounting of work builds 
trust and rapport. I recommend documenting a high level description for 
every 1-2 hours of work.

Example:

    Week of July, 4 - Accomplished

    * Define order processing forms
    * Build order forms
    * Tests for order forms
    * Test for Order data model
    * Test and fix
    * Deploy to production

    Week of July, 4 - Objectives

    * Define order process
    * Integrate Stripe
    * Integrate PayPal
    * Test sample transactions
    * Test, Fix, Deploy
    * Refactoring of ordering code

    Week of July, 4 - Challenges

    * Handling of secret keys for Stripe
    * Evaluate alternative payment systems


In a few bullets you can gain credibility by establishing lightweight 
transparency with the bosses and clients. There is no reason not to do 
this and every reason to start immediately.


### Step 3 - Static Website Using Github

Your client should have access to a shared repo where all communication happens. This could either
be inside your development repo or held as a separate repo for client communication. This has numerous 
advantages over other forms of communication.

Documents can be written in Markdown and are easily viewed with nice formatting. The version
control system manages the documents and a full change history can be obtained to understand
when certain changes took place. Most project management tools do a great job of showing the 
current status but not how we got there.

Clients may even be able to update the content on the communication site by themselves.  dYou may
want to explore this at the beginning of the project.  

The biggest problem with project documents is that they get out of date.  Tdhis often happens 
because there is a collection of documents that are not organized well. Over time they fall into
disuse. An organizational structure like the Planning Grid, Weekly Updates, and Engineering Notes
can be a simple index. This will quickly become an indispensable tool that keeps the client in
sync with the development team.

One simple **README.md** at the top of the communication repo can contain a Planning Grid Table
created as a Markdown document. Each cell in the table can link to a page in Github that is also
written in Markdown. In ten minutes any client can learn how to navigate
through the documents easily. The plans and agreements are a key part of the project so they must be under
version control too.


### Step 4 - Dynamic Website or Commercial Project Planning?

There is a wide offering of commercial project planning products. My favorites are Jira, Github Project, 
Trello, and ShortCut. Most of these have a free tier and then add on services for paid subscriptions.

Another alternative to consider is building your own app specifically for communicating with
clients. The objects in the system represent the different planning elements: Milestones, Roles,
Tasks, Requirements. These objects can be edited by the entire team and special reports can
summarize key subsets of the overall plan. If you keep it simple, this approach may make sense for certain
situations.
