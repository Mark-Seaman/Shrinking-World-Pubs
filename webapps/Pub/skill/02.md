## Skill 2 - Setup Python Environment


### Step 1 - Install Python 3

Every modern computer is now shipping with Python built-in. This Python
environment is not intended to be used for building applications. It is
meant to execute simple scripts to do tasks for system administration.

When you are doing application development you need to have complete
control of the Python version that you are running as well as all of the
packages that are needed for your application. Don't use the Python
version that ships with your system, it may end in disaster!

We will install a fresh version of Python that is the latest and
greatest. Then we will install all of the necessary libraries on top of
that version. This version of Python will be totally isolated from all
the other versions of Python on your machine and have its own lifecycle.
Follow these instructions to set up Python 3.

Make sure you set the Windows path variables in the installer

Confirm that you are running the best version of Python

    which python

    python --version # Should be 3.10 or greater

Keep working until you get the version you need


### Step 2 - Setup a Virtual Environment

Set up a Virtual Environment for each major project that you create. All
work in Python should be done in a virtual environment. This lets you
use different libraries for each project. We will be using a tool
"pyenv" to set up and activate our virtual environment. This will save
us some extra work and prevent errors. Select the Python version to use
and install all of the required packages within this Virtual
Environment.

We start by creating a Virtual Environment and then activating it. Once
this is done we can install all the required packages.

    $ python -m venv venv

    $ source venv/bin/activate # On Mac

    $ source venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows

To deactivate the Virtual Environment use this command.

    $ deactivate


### Step 3 - Installing Python Packages

PIP is the Package Installer for Python. It will be used to set up the
virtual environment for development. The only package we need in order
to begin is Django.

Activate the Virtual Environment before installing the packages. Install
the Django libraries into the Virtual Environment.

    $ pip install django
