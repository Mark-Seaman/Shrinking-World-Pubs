## Skill 5 - Deploy to Development Server


###  Deploy a Development Application Server 

Once you have mastered how to create a static web server you are ready to take
it to the next level. The process for creating an application server at Digital
Ocean is similar but adds several new configuration steps.
During development, we are far more concerned with getting our application running
properly than we are about security. That changes as our code goes into production.
When real users are depending on a service we must make sure that the server
is secure and robust. This is not hard to do but it is absolutely essential.

Using App Platform we can quickly create a new server in a few minutes. If 
needed we can destroy the server and recreate it at any time, based on the
configuration data from the existing server. This acts as a recipe that can 
be used to create new applications as needed.

This guide (Skill 5) will walk you through the process step-by-step and show
you the necessary specific settings. Follow the guide until you feel 
confident to go "off-road" by yourself. There is nothing sacred about these
details but they have been chosen to give you a "quick win".


### App Platform Project

App Platform provides all the infrastructure that is needed to run an
application. Creating a new top-level application can be done in a few minutes. 
There are a number of configuration options that are all specified when we
create the application.

The Digital Ocean website is used to create a new app and get the options set
properly.  Details for creating a new app are provided by Skill #7.  Here is a
summary of the overall process to guide you.


### Django Execution Environment

Before you can deploy an application to the internet you must first get it 
running properly on your local computer.  We need to make our Development 
Environment as similar as possible to the production environment.
In practice, this comes down to four elements:

* Python version that runs our code
* Django and other Python package versions
* Database connection
* Environment variables

Each of these elements could be different between the Development Environment and 
the Production Environment. These differences create a situation that allows bugs to 
leak into our Production Environment unnoticed. Our goal
will be to minimize the differences so that testing on the Development Environment
applies directly to the Production Environment.


Now we will repeat the steps that we did to set up the static web server. But this time
we will define some added options that are needed for the Django code.

To get your app hosted you need to follow this guide carefully.
Move slow to move fast. Mistakes are easy to make and will cost you a lot of time.

This setup guide assumes you have created an app and pushed it to Github.

* Create your code repo
* Create New Application at Digital Ocean
* Configure your app
* App-Level Environment variables
* Create a job to deploy code
* Force Rebuild & Deploy
* Test on the Server


### Step 1 - Create A New Application

Log into Digital Ocean at https://digitalocean.com.

Create a new application project with App Platform.  Connect to your repo and select the directory.
This time set up the "Source Directory" to point to 
"02/AppProfile".  This will examine the content of that directory to see what type of an app is located
there.  Point to the directory with "**manage.py**".

Verify name and type of resource to create

### Step 2 - Configure your app (use these settings)

* Source Directory: /02/AppProfile
* Type: Web Services (no change)
* Environment Variables: Leave blank
* Build Command: Leave blank
* Run Command:

    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm mysite.wsgi

* HTTP Port: 8080 (no change)
* HTTP Request Routes: / (no change)

Build Command

    default

Run Command

    python manage.py migrate --no-input
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi

Deploying an application at Digital Ocean is quite easy. You can specify a
Github repo with a branch and a path. Configuring the App Platform is done
by looking at the specific source code. 

To deploy a static site you need a file at the root.

    index.html

Deploying a Django app requires that you have

    requirements.txt
    runtime.txt

**runtime.txt** declares the version of Python.

    python-3.10.4

**requirements.txt** declares the Python packages to install.

    Django
    gunicorn


### Step 3 - App-Level Environment variables.

Your App Platform apps will have several components

* Django app (ProfileApp)
* Static web server
* Database

Configure App-Level Environment variables

* Go To https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps  
* Select your application

Click Settings and scroll down to "App-Level Environment Variables"

Add the following key/value pairs

    DEBUG = 0
    DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

Click Save.

### Step 4 - Deploy Static Server

Review the costs (Basic Plan - $5/month)
