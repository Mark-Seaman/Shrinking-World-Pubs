##  Skill 8 - View with Variables



Follow this recipe to add variable data to your view.  Show images within your views.


### Step 1 - Build Views with Data 

Start with the code that contained a simple TemplateView.  We want to avoid duplicating code.
If we have many similar views we want to create a generalized template that can be customized
slightly to need the needs.

Let's revisit our Superhero views and adapt the code to show some variable data.  Instead of 
"hard-coding" the values into the template we insert placeholder variables.


**templates/hulk.html**

    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>Secret identity:  {{ id }}</p>
    <img src="{{ image }}" alt="{{ image }}">


The view will fill in these values by passing a Python dictionary.  Each specific view will use
the same template but pass in different values.  We have also added an image to the template that
will be displayed based on the value set in the view code.


**hero/views.py**

    class HulkView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'hero.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return {
                'title': 'Hulk',
                'id': 'Bruce Banner',
                'image': '/static/images/hulk.jpg'
            }


    class IronManView(TemplateView):
        template_name = "hero.html"

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return {
                'title': 'Iron Man',
                'id': 'Tony Stark',
                'image': '/static/images/iron_man.jpg'
            }


The only other thing that must be done, is to declare the URL route for the HTTP request.
When the page is requested the Python view code is called to form the response.

**config/urls.py**

    from django.urls import path
    from .views import HulkView, IronManView

    urlpatterns = [
        path('hulk',    HulkView.as_view()),
        path('ironman', IronManView.as_view()),
    ]



### Step 2 - Static Web Server

To display images locally on your computer you can just run the development server.  It is capable
of creating a static web server to show the static files.  All that is needed is to set up the
settings file to point to the location of the static files.

Set up a static server that is used locally during testing.
Create a directory for the static files. In production, you will need to create a static server.
The easiest way to do this on App Platform at Digital Ocean is to define an "index.html" file.
This will confirm that the "static" directory should be converted into a static web server for
our images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

    $ mkdir static
    $ touch static/index.html 
Next, we need to customize the **settings.py** file to describe our application.

**config/settings.py**

    # On Digital Ocean it will use the Static Server
    # Locally you need to enable the static media server (Images, CSS, Javascript)
    
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "static"]



### Step 3 - Test/Commit/Push

Test Locally

    $ python manage.py runserver

Browse to the web page at **http://localhost:8000/hulk** and **http://localhost:8000/ironman**

Commit changes to Git

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'Create Photos app' 
    $ git push
