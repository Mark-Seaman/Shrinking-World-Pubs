## Skill 17 - Development Database



During development you can build your database using the database server that
Django provides. This doesn't have a robust commercial database engine, but it is
enough to get you started. You will want to replace it with a more 
permanent solution before product release.


### Step 1 - Use Development Database

To create the database for development you just need to run the **migrate**
command in Django. This will use the migration scripts that you created when you
did the **makemigrations** command earlier. These Python scripts are used to
create the database and modify the tables to conform to the data models in the
code.

The first time you run migrate it will create the database and subsequent times 
it will make changes to the database structure.

The most important limitation of the development database is that the database
content is simply a file in the file system. Django provides a SQLite database
by default in the settings.py file created with the "django-admin startproject"
command.  

This file is located in the application directory and named "db.sqlite3". Each
time the code is deployed this file is replaced by the file in your git repo.
This means that all of your data is replaced by content that you created on
your development machine. All data created on your server is lost.


### Step 2 - Create New Database on Deployment

App Platform supports databases in several ways. By simply executing a migrate
command, a temporary development database will be created for you on each new
deployment.

Sometimes this is good enough for trying out fresh ideas. The big downside
with this is that the database is reset every time you deploy new code to the
server.

If you do not care about the data created on the server but wish to load the
database content from your local server, this may not be a big issue.
You can use **dumpdata** to save a JSON file and then put the JSON file in
the Github repo. During deployment you can execute a run command that loads
the data into the database. 

Run Command

    python manage.py migrate --no-input
    python manage.py loaddata data.json
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi

In the next section we will look at how to prevent data loss
during deployment. It makes sense to get your application working properly
with a SQLite database before moving to a permanent database.
