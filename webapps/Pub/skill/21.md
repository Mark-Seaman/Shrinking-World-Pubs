## Skill 21 - User Status



### Step 1 -  Show Login Status

The users should be able to see whether they are currently logged in. Django
provides information to be added to web pages that indicate the user status.

This information can be added to a "Navbar" that is available on every page.

![User Status](img/UserStatus.png)

The following template code can show the user info in every view. It relies
on the "user" object that is available from the HTTP request.

template/user.html

    {% if user.is_authenticated %}

        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'logout' %}">Hello {{ user.username }}</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'logout' %}">Log out</a>
        </li>

        {% else %}

        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'login' %}">Log In</a>
        </li>

        <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign Up</a>
        </li>

    {% endif %}



### Step 2 - Check User Authorization

To require that a user be logged in before viewing a page is quite easy.
The view is modified to check the login status prior to returning the HTTP 
response for the page. If the user is not logged in then they are redirected
to a login page. After successfully logging in they are automatically 
returned to the page they are after.

views.py

    from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin

    class SecretView(LoginRequiredMixin, TemplateView):
        template_name = "page.html"

It is extremely difficult to get user accounts working correctly. With Django
it is a breeze.  Once you have done it a few times the process can be complete
in just a few minutes.
