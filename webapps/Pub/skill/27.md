## Skill 27 - Complex Views



### Step 1 - Build View with Tabs 

Tabbed views are a common way to simplify the presentation of a lot
of information for the user.  They are also tricky to set up without a 
real web server doing a lot of the work.

Bootstrap provides us with sample code to demo how to use the tabs
in our views.  But to create a view of any size is very difficult to accomplish
by hand.  There are a large number of control variables that must all be 
set properly.

Demo 9 contains all the code you need to get started.  The view creates a
data dictionary based on the panels that you would like to show.  It then
sets up all of the control settings to run your tab panels.  All of the tricky
stuff is handled in the "tabs_data" function.


views.py

    class TabsView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'tabs.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return dict(title='Tab View', tabs=tabs_data())


    def tabs_data():

        def options(i, tab, selected):
            data = tab
            if selected:
                data.update(dict(name=f'tab{i}', active='active', 
                    show='show', selected='true'))
            else:
                data.update(dict(name=f'tab{i}', active='', 
                    show='', selected='false'))
            return data

        def set_options(tabs):
            return [options(i, tab, i == 0) for i, tab in enumerate(tabs)]

        panels = [
                    card_data(title="Tab 1", body='panel 1'),
                    card_data(title="Tab 2", body='panel 2'),
                    card_data(title="Tab 3", body='panel 3'),
                ]

        return set_options(panels)


templates/tabs.html

    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">

        {% for t in tabs %}
            <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link {{ t.active }}" 
                    id="{{ t.name }}-tab" 
                    data-bs-toggle="tab" 
                    href="#{{ t.name }}">
                    {{ t.header }}
                </a>
            </li>
        {% endfor %}

    </ul>

    <div class="tab-content">

        {% for t in tabs %}

            <div class="tab-pane {{ t.active }} {{ t.show }} fade" 
                id="{{ t.name }}">

                <h2>{{ t.header }}</h2>

                {% autoescape off %}
                {{ t.body }}
                {% endautoescape %}

            </div>

        {% endfor %}

    </div>



### Step 2 - Build Accordion Views

An accordion is a Bootstrap component that help you organize the data on a
page.  If is made of a series of collapsible views.  Each section of the
accordion can be expanded or collapsed by the user.  This makes it very
convenient to present a large amount of information that users can digest
in small amounts.

Bootstrap provides us with sample code to demo how to use the accordion
control.  But to create a view of any size is very difficult to accomplish
by hand.  There are a large number of control variables that must all be 
set properly.

Django provides infrastructure to let you build a generic control that accept
data values from the server.  This is a perfect match to let you set up an
accordion view quickly and easily.

Demo 9 contains all the code you need to get started.  The view creates a
data dictionary based on the panels that you would like to show.  It then
sets up all of the control settings to run your accordion.  All of the tricky
stuff is handled in the "accordion_data" function.


views.py

    class AccordionView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'accordion.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return dict(accordion=accordion_data())


    def accordion_data():

        def create_card(i):
            return f'<h2>Lessons (week {i})</h2><p>...</p>'

        def card_content(i, active):
            card = card_data(f'Week {i+1}', create_card(i+1))
            if i == active:
                card.update(dict(id=i, collapsed='', show='show', aria='true'))
            else:
                card.update(dict(id=i, collapsed='collapsed', show='', aria='false'))
            return card

        return [card_content(i, 11) for i in range(12)]


templates/accordion.html

    <div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">

        {% for card in accordion %}

        <div class="accordion-item">

            <h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading-{{ card.id }}">

                <button class="accordion-button {{ card.collapsed }}" 
                    type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                    data-bs-target="#collapse-{{ card.id }}" 
                    aria-expanded="{{ card.aria }}"
                    aria-controls="collapse-{{ card.id }}">

                    {{ card.title }}

                </button>

            </h2>

            <div id="collapse-{{ card.id }}" 
                class="accordion-collapse collapse {{ card.show }}"
                aria-labelledby="heading-{{ card.id }}" 
                data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

                <div class="accordion-body bg-light">
                    {% autoescape off %}
                    {{ card.body }}
                    {% endautoescape %}
                </div>

            </div>

        </div>

        {% endfor %}
    </div>



### Step 3 - Build Super Views

Using this design pattern it is possible to create a single template that
can handle a wide variety of data elements.  The view selects the elements
that it wants to display and passes them into the template.

This pattern is useful when you have a part of a page that may contain many
different types of data and you want the bulk of the page to stay the same.


views.py


    class SuperView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'super.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return dict(table=create_table())


templates/super.html

    {% extends 'theme.html' %}

    {% block content %}

        {% include '_documents.html' %}
        {% include '_cards.html' %}
        {% include '_table.html' %}
        {% include '_carousel.html' %}
        {% include '_accordion.html' %}
        {% include '_tabs.html' %}

    {% endblock content %}
