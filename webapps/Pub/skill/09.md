##  Skill 9 - Add Variables to View



There is still some duplicated code here.  If we have 50 pages for different heroes we must
define code for 50 different views and the URLs to map to each view.
This is clearly not a general solution.  The next step is to look at the name of the URL being
requested and then match the correct data values.



### Step 1 - Pass Data From URL

We will use the template that we defined before.

**templates/hulk.html**

    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>Secret identity:  {{ id }}</p>
    <img src="{{ image }}" alt="{{ image }}">


The view will fill in these values by passing a Python dictionary.  Each specific view will use
the same template but pass in different values.  We have also added an image to the template that
will be displayed based on the value set in the view code.

When the view is called the data gleaned from the URL is passed as a Python dictionary.  
The hero name can be found by looking at **kwargs['hero']**.  This name is used as the key to
gather the specific details that are sent to the template.


**hero/views.py**

    hero_info = {
        'hulk': {
                'title': 'Hulk',
                'id': 'Bruce Banner',
                'image': '/static/images/hulk.jpg'
            },
        'ironman': {
                'title': 'Iron Man',
                'id': 'Tony Stark',
                'image': '/static/images/iron_man.jpg'
            },
    }

    class HeroView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'hero.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            hero = kwargs['hero']
            return hero_info[hero]


The only other thing that must be done, is to declare the URL route for the HTTP request.
When the page is requested the Python view code is called to form the response.

**config/urls.py**

    from django.urls import path
    from .views import HeroView

    urlpatterns = [
        path('<str:hero>', HeroView.as_view()),
    ]


Example URLs include

* http://localhost:8000/hulk 
* http://localhost:8000/ironman

All other pages will throw an exception until we provide error handling to return a nice message.

Now a single template, a single view, and a single URL will work to display all heroes.  The master
dictionary holds all of the detailed info that changes with each hero.  Later we will replace this
logic with a database.
