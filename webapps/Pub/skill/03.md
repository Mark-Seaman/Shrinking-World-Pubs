## Skill 3 - Running a Django Application


### Step 1 - Development Server

Before we create our own application we must learn how to run an
existing Django app. The Django Framework provides its own web server to
run your code for testing during development. This works great for
trying out ideas on your local computer.

In Chapter 2 we will cover how to set up an App Server Hosting
environment to make your application visible on the internet. For now,
we will focus on running your app on your own computer using the Django
development server.

Go to the directory with "manage.py" and execute ...

    $ python manage.py runserver

This launches the development server so that you can view the web pages
in your browser. Skill #1 provides you with step-by-step instructions to
set up your Python environment to the point where you can run Django
code. Make sure you set up all the tools properly before you try to run
the code.

Don't worry about the warning for "unapplied migrations"


### Step 2 - Run Development Server in Terminal
Browse to the web page at **http://localhost:8000**

Test the application code in the repo at
"https://github.com/your-name/PythonWebApps/01/ProfileApp" to verify
your Django setup. Keep working on it until it shows the profile page
along with the image and stylesheet.
In the next chapter, we'll address how to take this app into the wilds
of the internet.

You should see the web page for the default URL route.

Use Ctrl-C to kill the server.


### Step 3 - Create a New App

Create a new Django project and test the new app by running the server.

    $ django-admin startproject config 

    $ python manage.py runserver

Your view should show the "coming soon" feedback.

This page is shown when a new Django app has not yet been configured to
run. This means that Django is installed properly and ready to go.
