## Skill 1 - Visual Studio Code & Github


### Step 1 - Install Visual Studio Code

There are many great development tools that are available for building
applications. Feel free to use any tool that you are already comfortable
with. For this book, we will standardize on Microsoft Visual Studio
Code. Other popular tools include Sublime Text and PyCharm.

VS Code is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has, at its
heart, a programmer's editor. But it also provides many advanced tools
that will make your work easier.

-   Color syntax highlighting to help you write code
-   Code completion
-   Static analysis
-   Framework for running tests
-   Framework to run the server
-   and much, much more

Your first task will be to install VS code on your computer and get it
configured properly. Go to the official website at
https://code.visualstudio.com to install the proper version of Visual
Studio Code for your operating system. Download and install it on your
machine.


### Step 2 - Install Git

Git is the industry standard for version control systems. There are
dozens of systems available, but Git is the unchallenged leader. Linus
Torvalds created Git while he was writing Linux. Yes, the same guy that
gave us Linux also built Git. He felt that other versioning systems
lacked the features that would allow them to accommodate extremely large
projects with thousands of developers.

Git allows users to work individually or with thousands of developers.
Work is merged together to form new versions of the code. The full
version history of all files is saved so you can restore any previous
content at any time. A history of changes is easy to see and review.

Things to remember:

-   Save every version of every file while you work.
-   Use good comments on every commit.
-   Put everything under version control.


### Step 3 - Setup Github Account

Github is the best version control service available to manage Git code
repositories. It is a web service that hosts thousands of users and
millions of projects. By January 2020, Github had 40 million users and over 100 million repositories.

You can work with the website directly to manage your code. More
commonly Git repos are cloned onto your local computer and then changes
are synched back to Github.

In the commercial world, all work is shared by using Git repositories
hosted at a web service (such as Github or BitBucket). Using Git is a
good skill to hone now.

Register for a Github account by completing the following tasks

-   Visit the Github website at https://github.com
-   Select a name that will be your permanent Github user name
-   Sign up for a free account at Github
-   Login to your account


### Step 4 - Fork the "Python-Web-Apps" Repo

Fork the repo for "Mark-Seaman/PythonWebApps"

    https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/PythonWebApps

This will create your own copy of the repo with permission to make
changes

    https://github.com/your-name/PythonWebApps

Visit your repo at Github to verify it


### Step 5 - Clone Your Web App Repo

You may need to install the git command-line software. This will let you
perform the needed git commands. Run a terminal window and execute the
command

    $ git

If you are missing git, install it from
"https://git-scm.com/downloads". Check the installation by executing
the command again.

Run Visual Studio and go to the source control tab. Go to "View" menu
and select "Source Control". Then choose "Clone Repository", which
will walk you through the process of cloning your repo. This will move
the files onto your local computer and maintain the connection back to
Github. All changes will be synchronized to and from Github.

Clone your repo to make changes, replacing **your-name** with your Github user account id.

    git clone git@github.com:your-name/PythonWebApps.git


Use the Source Control tab to interactively commit your changes and push
and pull them to/from Github. Now Visual Studio Code will complete the
operations for you.
