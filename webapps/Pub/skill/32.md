## Skill 32 - Markdown Documents 


### Overview

Markdown is a simple language to add simple formatting instructions to text.
For sites with a good deal of textual content it is best to avoid writing 
in HTML. Markdown is mostly text with a few formatting constructs that give
you a great deal of control.

Because Markdown is based on text it works very well with version control.
It is human-readable and can be easily displayed as HTML.


### Markdown Format

I recommend greatly restricting the formatting used in order to make your code easy to
read and understand. Consider these constructs:

    # Main Headline

    ## Sub Headline

    ### Minor Heading

    * Bullet list
    * Second item in list

You can learn Markdown in a few minutes and greatly improve your productivity.
This requires that you master writing, reading, and displaying Markdown 
documents in your application.



### Step 1 - Read Document

Open the matching file and convert the contents from Markdown to HTML.

**views.py**

    from markdown import markdown

    def doc_data(document):
        path = Path(document)
        markdown_text = path.read_text()
        return {'html': markdown(markdown_text)}


Pass in the required document file in the URL.

**urls.py**

    urlpatterns = [

        path('doc/<str:doc>', DocumentView.as_view()),
    ]




### Step 2 - Display Document

The view code can read a Markdown file and convert it into HTML.  This code can be injected into a
template with other HTML elements. To properly display the html text by turn off 'autoescape' in
the template being used.  When doing this you must ensure that the content of the Markdown file is
from a trusted source.


**views.py**

    class DocumentView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'document.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            return doc_data(self.kwargs.get('doc'))


**templates/document.html**

    {% autoescape off %}
        {{ html }}
    {% endautoescape %}
