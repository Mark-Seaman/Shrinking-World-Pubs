## Skill 38 - Continuous Integration

### Step 1 - Incremental Development


Throughout the entire project we will build small pieces of functionality and get them fully
created, tested, and integrated into the whole. Before moving on to the next feature the current
feature must be fully developed and deployed. Using this technique, our entire system is ready to
go at any moment. We never break the system and leave it in a broken state while trying to add new
code.

Incremental development implies that we build the entire system in small steps. Each step is
integrated with all of the functionality that we already have and the whole thing is tested. This
implies a continuous process of integration and testing.


### Step 2 - Continuous Integration

Whenever code is pushed to the git repo a test is performed. If the test passes, then code is built
and deployed to the staging server. It is tested on the server and only gets a green light if
everything is perfect. If any errors occur, the alarms are triggered and people are notified.

This automation of Code, Test, Deploy, Test is what continuous integration is all about. Power tools
like Jenkins can be set up to trigger all these activities and the notifications to the responsible
parties. Running this gauntlet with every commit greatly increases the likelihood of a good
release. Problems are discovered early and solutions are put in place to ensure that the whole
system works well.


### Step 3 - Server Configuration

Another aspect of doing continuous integration well, is setting up the development machine
environments to match the production server environment. This guarantees that everything that is
tested reflects the eventual production context.

Doing continuous integration and continuous deployment minimizes the time required for customers to
get the latest features. When the testing is thorough, the process proven to produce
a software release with very little overhead. But if the test coverage is poor then the whole
process tends to break down.
