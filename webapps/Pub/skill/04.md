## Skill 4 - Deploy a Static Web Server


### Step 1 - Register at Service Provider

This book will be using Digital Ocean as our service provider.  Other providers are available
that will meet the needs but I will illustrate all of the deployment steps with Digital Ocean.  This
will let the new users see the details of deployment and get a quick win.  

This will build your confidence if you choose to use another service provider.  All of the details
will change but the overall approach will be similar. 

Create an Account on Digital Ocean at https://digitalocean.com.

Create a new application project with the App Platform
