## Project 6 - Superhero Data Views


### Overview

Create an application that uses a database to save information about superheroes.
Use the built-in views provided by Django to support all five operations on
the records.

* ListView
* DetailView
* CreateView
* UpdateView
* DeleteView

Create templates for each view. Use the same data model that you defined in 
Project 5. Each page in your app will display data from a record in the
database. The "pk" in the URL will be used to look up the rest of the
information about the hero to display.

You will have five heroes listed on your site. 
The index page will present a list of links to the
other five pages. The other pages will contain a profile of your favorite
superheroes. It will display the strengths and weaknesses of the hero along with a
profile photo. The links within the pages allow you to move easily between all
pages.

* Deploy code to your server


**User Stories**

* Each page displays info about one hero
* Pages use CSS to present a nice appearance
* List the heroes currently in your database
* Profile page for each hero
* Manipulate records using Django custom views


### Requirements

**Business Requirements**

* Your repo contains all of your code
* Your server is hosted at Digital Ocean
* You have created and debugged a Django application with Hero Profiles
* Hero List View
    * For default URL "/" display a list of know superheroes
* Hero Detail View
    * Create a unique page for each superhero
    * Show Name, Image, Strengths, Weaknesses
    * Create a nicely styled set of pages similar to my profile page

**Technical Requirements**

* Superhero Database with at least five superheroes
* Superhero Data Model
    * name, identity, description, strength, weakness, image
    * Set default keyword argument in new fields added
* Superhero Custom Views
    * List
    * Detail
    * Add
    * Edit
    * Delete
* Views Stylesheet
    * View inheritance
    * CSS



### Step 1 - Create a new Django project
* startproject Superhero
* startapp hero
* Build HTML template "index.html"
* Set a title "Superhero News"
* Debug URL route for '/'
* Commit to your Github repo


### Step 2 - Define Python class
Define the Superhero data model (name, identity, description, strength, weakness, image)

Set default keyword argument in new fields added

hero/models.py

    class Superhero(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        identity = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        description = models.TextField()
        strength = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        weakness = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        image = models.CharField(max_length=100)


### Step 3 - Data Migrations

Create the scripts to update the database and apply the migrations.

    python manage.py makemigrations hero
    
    python manage.py migrate


### Step 4 - Enable Django Tests
* Use the Django infrastructure to run tests
* Perform Test Driven Development
    * Views
    * Data
    * Business logic


### Step 5 - Add Heroes
* Use the Admin views to 
    * Add records
    * Modify records
    * Delete records


### Step 6 - Add five Superhero records
* Create database records with a CreateView
* List record links with a ListView
* Show the details with a DetailView


### Step 7 - Create Superhero Pages
* Build a view that takes a "hero" argument and displays the name
* Build an URL route that matches "hero/pk" and calls your view


### Step 8 - Superhero Index
* Add a list of links to invoke your hero page
* Create links from the database records


### Step 9 - Create Images 
* Create images that match your five selected heroes
* Add an image to your view to display the superhero image
* Debug your application code until photos display
* Commit to your Github repo
* Deploy at Digital Ocean


### Step 10 - Create Superhero Theme
* Create an HTML template "superhero_theme.html"
* Add a bootstrap CSS and custom CSS to this template
* Add a "{% block content %}" section to the template
* Make index.html and hero.html use "{% extends 'superhero_theme.html' %}"
* Debug the view inheritance
* Give your pages some cool style
