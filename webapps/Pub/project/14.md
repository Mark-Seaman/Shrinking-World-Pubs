## Project 14 - Software Planner


### Overview

Create a simple app to track the software development activity. Each Milestone should contain
a number of Tasks to be completed.

The user will be able to create, read, update, and delete both the Milestones and Tasks through
the website. Create a full project plan for software development by creating specific tasks and
milestones. Imagine that you were going to repeat the Superhero project as a
commercial software app.

This is a very typical application that you are likely to build many times in your career.  
Plan the steps as if you were just beginning the project or as if you were a consultant helping
someone else to complete the work.
