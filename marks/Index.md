# Career

My career path has always been characterised by a deep commitment to learning and sharing best practices. 

I have spent over 40 years in the software engineering industry, working on a wide range of projects and technologies.
My journey has taken me from software development to teaching and writing, and I have always strived to share my
knowledge and experience with others. I am passionate about helping others learn and grow, and I am always looking for
new ways to innovate and improve.

Over my career I've had the opportunity to work as a software engineer, technical leader, entrepreneur, college professor and writer. 
Each of these gave me unique opportunities to learn and share knowledge with others.
