Note: Examples of guiding concepts of building blocks and abstraction in this chapter include:
- Building blocks for DNA replication and repair include nucleotides, polymerases, enzymes, and repair pathways, which are used to assemble, copy, and maintain genetic information.
- Abstraction in DNA replication and repair includes the semi-conservative nature of replication, as well as the specific mechanisms and pathways involved in repairing various types of DNA damage.
- Building blocks for telomere maintenance include telomerase and the shelterin complex, whichare essential for maintaining the protective structures at the ends of chromosomes.
- Abstraction in telomere maintenance includes the connection to aging and cellular senescence, and the use of telomere length as a potential biomarker for age-related diseases.
- Building blocks for recombination and transposition include endonucleases and mobile genetic elements, which can cause genetic mutations and contribute to genetic diversity.
- Abstraction in recombination and transposition includes the different mechanisms of cut-and-paste and copy-and-paste transposition, which allow for the movement and insertion of genetic elements in the genome.
