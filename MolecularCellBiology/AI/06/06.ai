Chapter 5 discusses how the various components of chromatin work together to regulate gene expression. It covers the role of histones and nucleosomes, including how their modifications influence gene expression. The chapter also delves into gene regulation, including the role of transcription factors, enhancers, and promoters. Chromatin organization is also explored, including the formation of chromatin domains and the higher-order organization of chromatin within the nucleus. The chapter concludes by highlighting the significance of understanding chromatin structure and dynamics in the context of cellular processes and diseases associated with dysregulated gene expression.
