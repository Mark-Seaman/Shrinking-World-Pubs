# 7. Organelles, Specialized Functions, and the Foundations of Organs
   - Introduction: Division of labor in biological systems
     * Cellular organelles and their importance
     * Specialized functions in cells and organs
   - Differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells
     * Diffusion and reaction times
     * Membrane compartmentalization in eukaryotes
     * Phase condensates and chromatin regions
     * Examples of eukaryotic cell compartmentalization
   - Membrane-bound organelles and their specialized functions
     * Mitochondria: energy production
     * Endoplasmic reticulum: protein synthesis and modification
     * Golgi apparatus: protein sorting and packaging
     * Vacuoles: storage and waste disposal
     * Lysosomes: digestion and recycling
  - The development of organs as groups of specialized cells
    * Stem cell differentiation
    * All cells have the same genome, your toes can think, your ears can see, your eyes digest. None of them do it very well due to specialization
