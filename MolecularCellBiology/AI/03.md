# Previous Chapter Summary
Chapter 2 of the book focuses on DNA, the molecule that serves as the blueprint for all living organisms. The chapter discusses the atomic structure of DNA, nucleotides as the building blocks of the genetic code, the universality of the genetic code, and the central dogma of molecular biology. The backbone of DNA is made up of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules, while the nucleotide bases follow specific pairing rules known as Watson-Crick base pairing. The chapter also explains the discovery of DNA, the sequence hypothesis, and the special sequences present in DNA such as CpG islands. The universality of the genetic code and the redundancy of the codons used by almost all living organisms are highlighted, as well as the central dogma of molecular biology which describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system.

# Chapter 3: Building Genes to Make Proteins

## 3.1 The Structure and Organization of Genes
   - The linear organization of genes on chromosomes
   - Introns and exons: the coding and non-coding regions of genes
   - Regulatory elements: promoters, enhancers, and silencers
   - Alternative splicing: generating protein diversity from a single gene

## 3.2 Transcription: From DNA to RNA
   - The role of RNA polymerase in transcription
   - Initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription
   - The building blocks of RNA: ribonucleotides
   - Transcription factors and their role in gene regulation

## 3.3 RNA Processing
   - The addition of the 5' cap and the 3' poly-A tail
   - Splicing: the removal of introns and joining of exons
   - Spliceosome: the molecular machinery of splicing
   - Alternative splicing and its role in protein diversity

## 3.4 Translation: From RNA to Protein
   - The role of ribosomes in translation
   - The building blocks of proteins: amino acids
   - The genetic code: codons and the translation of mRNA
   - Initiation, elongation, and termination of translation
