# Previous Chapter Summary
Chapter 4 explores the world of proteins, highlighting their incredible diversity, versatility, and complexity. Proteins play a variety of essential roles in living organisms, from molecular motors to structural support, communication, catalysts, and defense. Proteins are built from 20 different amino acids, which can be combined in any order to create a vast array of possible protein sequences. The specific order of amino acids in a protein determines its three-dimensional structure, or fold, which is essential for its proper function. Protein folding is a complex and highly cooperative process, and misfolded proteins can result in loss of function or contribute to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Proteins also interact with each other to form complexes, which are essential for many cellular processes. These interactions are mediated by specific regions on the protein surface, and the specificity of these interactions is crucial for ensuring the proper assembly and function of protein complexes. By understanding the principles underlying protein structure and function, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complex and awe-inspiring world of biological processes.
