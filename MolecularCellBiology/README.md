## Publishing Details

### Text Book Pages
* Pages can be viewed through the Shrinking World Pubs website
* The content of this repo is displayed using the Digital Ocean app 
* The Genetics textbook is one of many pubs that will be produced

### Chet Requests

* Content creation begins by making requests to our artificial author
partner, Chet Gupta (aka chatGPT).
* These requests are entered into chatGPT.
* The requests are stored in this directory as individual files to
give us an audit trail for the design process.

### Chet Responses

* Chet is producing lots of output in response to each request. The
output is stored for each of the requests.
* Some of these requests will be used as the best answer for one segment
of the book.
* Hand edited content is created as files in the directory 
"Shrinking-World-Pubs/Genetics/Book"
