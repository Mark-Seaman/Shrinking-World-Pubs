# A Journey into Connection

Before Stacie fell ill, we had planned a major shift in our lives. We were both set to retire and had booked an ocean
cruise—a long-dreamed-of adventure that would take us across the Atlantic and through Scandinavia. This was going to be
our celebration of a new chapter, focused solely on spending time together, indulging in the joy of each other’s
presence without the usual busyness that had defined our shared life.

But Stacie’s sudden illness altered everything. Now faced with the decision of whether to cancel the cruise or go alone,
I felt a profound pull to honor our shared plans. My daughter Rachel joined me, a comforting presence as we navigated
this voyage that had once been meant for two. My son Josiah joined us briefly as well, and then I had two weeks to
travel alone.

During this time, I challenged myself to engage with others, to use each mealtime as a chance to meet new people. This
was no small feat for me; I’ve never been one to approach strangers easily, let alone make friends of them. But meal by
meal, conversation by conversation, I found myself telling my story to people who quickly became more than strangers. By
the end of those two weeks, I had gained over twenty new friends. The experience showed me something vital: I could
still connect with others, even in the midst of grief. This ocean journey transformed into a journey toward connection,
and it gave me the courage to continue opening my life to new relationships and friendships.
