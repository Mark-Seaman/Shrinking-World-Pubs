# My Recent Journey

The journey into joy was unexpected. For months, grief defined me — I felt like a “grief walker,” trapped in conversations
and relationships that revolved around loss. Though healing came gradually, I longed for more. I missed a life filled
with hobbies, laughter, teaching, writing, and creating software. I craved conversations not shadowed by sorrow.

I’ve learned that my joy rests on three pillars: creation, connection, and enjoyment. Creativity is my most profound source of
vitality. Writing helps me unravel life’s complexities; teaching technology invigorates me; and innovation simplifies
life, offering satisfaction. These acts restore my sense of purpose and well-being.

Connection, too, is vital. As an introvert, I take time to trust, but I deeply cherish a few close friendships built
over decades. Family, friends, and my church provide a nurturing network that keeps me grounded. In their company, I
find warmth and belonging.

Lastly, enjoyment enriches life. I find joy in simple pleasures — playing guitar, walking in nature, reading, and travel.
Visiting over 30 countries has broadened my view, each journey layering my life with new perspectives.

After losing my wife, Stacie, life felt hollow. The trip to Greece changed that. With friends tracing the steps of the
apostle Paul, I rediscovered inspiration. Surrounded by like-minded people, my creativity reignited. I envisioned new
projects, felt music stir within me, and, for the first time in years, imagined future adventures.

This journey reawakened my spirit, reminding me joy was not lost — it was waiting to be reclaimed.
