# The Hardest Year

As I celebrate my 65th birthday, I reflect on the past year, a time of profound change and unimaginable loss. On
September 1, 2023, my life was on the brink of implosion, though I had no idea. Stacie, my beloved wife, and I were
overwhelmed with work, knowing our lives were unsustainable. We made an important decision to retire, hoping to spend
the next twenty years focusing on our family, marriage, and quality of life. We planned to travel, relax, and enjoy each
other's company, starting with an ocean cruise and a possible extended stay in Greece.

However, life had other plans. Over the next three months, Stacie fell ill and passed away, leaving me shattered. I lost
not only my wife but also my best friend, teacher, and confidant. The first quarter of 2024 was a period of intense
reckoning, where I had to come to terms with the full extent of my loss - my career, identity, and social life were all
tied to her.

I worked hard to establish a support network, engaging in hundreds of deep conversations to help me heal. I took the
cruise we had planned, visited our hometown, and faced the ghosts of our shared past. Now, as I stand at this
crossroads, I realize that my old life is gone forever. What remains is a blank slate, one I hope to fill with new
friendships, experiences, and, most importantly, joy.

As I process all of the events of life I am writing daily.  This is being published as I write, first online and
eventually as an Amazon Kindle book.  If you want to learn more about my recent journey you can start with this article,
