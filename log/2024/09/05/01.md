# Unexpected Return to Teaching

Today marks my unexpected return to the classroom, following my retirement from the University of Northern Colorado
(UNC) last December after seven years of teaching. At UNC’s Monfort College of Business, I had the privilege of leading
courses in Web Development and Software Engineering. Retirement felt right at the time, as I was eager to focus on
building my Shrinking World Academy, an online school that would expand on the work I had done in academia.

Before retiring, I worked closely with UNC to transition my courses, handing over the materials I had developed,
including three textbooks and fully designed curricula for three highly successful classes. It was deeply satisfying to
know I had made a lasting impact on the students and had laid the groundwork for future instructors.

This fall was the first semester that Intermediate Web Development class was taught by someone else. I was prepared to embrace my
new life of leisure, but fate had other plans. On Labor Day, just one week into the new semester, I received shocking
news: the professor who had taken over my class had passed away unexpectedly. With the students already immersed in
their first week, there was an urgent need to step in and ensure their education continued seamlessly. 

Now, I'm back in front of a familiar classroom, ready to guide these students through the rest of the semester — a return
I hadn’t anticipated, but one that feels like the right thing to do.  Now the challenge was to take the reins and lead the 
students through the rest of the semester. I was excited to see several students from the class I had previously taught on software engineering.
