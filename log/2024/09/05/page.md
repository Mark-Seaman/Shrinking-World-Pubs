# Unexpected Return to UNC

After retiring from the University of Northern Colorado last December, I never expected to return to the classroom. I
had spent seven years teaching Web Development and Software Engineering at the Monfort College of Business, where I
developed successful courses that equipped students with professional skills. My focus had shifted to building my
Shrinking World Academy, an online school designed to continue the work I had started.

However, on Labor Day, I received shocking news: the professor who had taken over my Web Development class had passed
away. By the following morning, I was asked to step back in and continue the course. I spent all of Tuesday preparing
for class, importing materials into Canvas, adjusting the curriculum, and reworking the syllabus to fit the new
schedule.

When I met the students, many familiar faces from previous courses were in the room, which brought a sense of comfort.
My goal has always been to ensure students leave my courses with the skills needed to land jobs as professional
developers. The hands-on, practical approach I developed over the years allowed me to meet this goal, and I was ready to
help this new group succeed.

Although the return was unexpected and under tragic circumstances, stepping back into the classroom has reminded me how
much I value making a difference in students' lives. This course remains the pinnacle of my teaching career, and being
able to guide these students again has brought a renewed sense of purpose.
