# Logistics of Teaching BACS 350

## Purpose

This report provides a summary of the logistics involved in teaching BACS 350. It covers the course's history, objectives, materials, and the changes required to ensure successful delivery.
This report outlines the necessary steps to deliver BACS 350 effectively, ensuring that students gain the skills required to succeed in modern web development.

## History of the Course

BACS 350 was first taught in 2018, focusing on providing students with hands-on experience in web application development. Initially, the course utilized a PHP/MySQL technology stack. In 2020, the course was redesigned to reflect industry trends, shifting to a Python/Django/PostgreSQL stack to enhance students' skills in modern web development. Now in its seventh iteration, the course has been continuously optimized each semester to ensure that students acquire marketable skills relevant to current job markets.

## Course Structure

The course is structured to prepare students for professional roles in web development, mirroring the expectations of a business owner looking to hire skilled developers. The course includes:

- **45 Recorded Video Lectures:** These lectures guide students through the skills needed for weekly projects.
- **14 Weekly Projects:** These projects are designed to be practical and hands-on, allowing students to build a web application step-by-step.
- **Final Deployment:** Students deploy their applications on Digital Ocean, culminating in a fully functional enterprise application.

Grading is based on students' engagement with the video lectures and their completion of projects. The course is self-paced, but regular feedback is provided to keep students on track. Additional support includes extended office hours and an online scheduling tool for personalized assistance.

## Course Materials

The course materials are comprehensive and designed to facilitate learning. They include:

- **45 Video Lectures:** Step-by-step guidance on web application development.
- **14 Weekly Projects:** Realistic projects that build progressively on the skills taught in the lectures.
- **Course Website:** A dedicated platform for delivering content.
- **Student Application:** A tool to track students' progress throughout the course.

These materials are integrated with Canvas for communication, homework tracking, and grading. Additionally, the course is supported by Shrinking World Academy and hosted on Teachable.com.

## Course Changes Required

To teach BACS 350 effectively, several changes are necessary:

1. **Use of Existing Materials:** The course syllabus needs to be reset to utilize the materials and processes developed specifically for this course. This includes shifting away from any alternate materials that may have been previously introduced.
   
2. **Access to Course Materials:** The course is available publicly on Shrinking World Academy for $140, but UNC students can access it at a discounted rate of $35. However, due to the late start and students already having purchased other textbooks, it is recommended that UNC covers the cost of these materials to ensure all students have access without additional financial burden.

3. **Adjustment to Course Structure:** As the course is already underway, it is proposed to drop one project, reducing the total from 14 to 13 projects. This will allow for the successful completion of all course content within the remaining time frame.

Approval of these changes is crucial to ensure the course's success and the students' ability to meet the learning objectives.
