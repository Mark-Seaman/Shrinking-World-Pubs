# Nuclear Tests

A total of 928 nuclear tests were conducted at the Nevada Test Site (now known as the Nevada National Security Site)
between 1951 and 1992. These tests included both atmospheric (above-ground) and underground detonations:

- **Atmospheric Tests**: Approximately 100 of these tests were conducted above ground, in the atmosphere, primarily
  during the early years of nuclear testing from 1951 to 1962. Atmospheric testing was halted after the United States
  signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which prohibited nuclear explosions in the atmosphere, underwater, and in
  outer space.

- **Underground Tests**: The remaining tests were conducted underground, where the bombs were detonated in shafts or
  tunnels to contain the explosion and minimize radioactive fallout. These underground tests continued until the United
  States voluntarily halted nuclear testing in 1992.

The Nevada Test Site was the primary location for nuclear testing in the United States during this period, and the tests
conducted there were part of the larger U.S. nuclear weapons development and stockpile maintenance programs.

The power of an atomic bomb (fission bomb) compared to a hydrogen bomb (thermonuclear bomb) differs significantly, both
in terms of the underlying mechanisms and the resulting explosive yield.


### Atomic Bomb (Fission Bomb):

- **Mechanism**: An atomic bomb relies on nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei (such as
  uranium-235 or plutonium-239) into smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. 
- **Yield**: The explosive yield of atomic bombs typically ranges from a few kilotons to about 500 kilotons of TNT. For
  example, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, "Little Boy," had a yield of about 15 kilotons, and the bomb dropped on
  Nagasaki, "Fat Man," had a yield of about 21 kilotons.


### Hydrogen Bomb (Thermonuclear Bomb):

- **Mechanism**: A hydrogen bomb utilizes both fission and fusion. The initial fission reaction generates the high
  temperatures and pressures needed to ignite nuclear fusion, where lighter nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogenâ€”deuterium
  and tritium) combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing even more energy. 
- **Yield**: The explosive yield of hydrogen bombs can range from hundreds of kilotons to many megatons of TNT. For
  example, the first hydrogen bomb test by the United States, "Ivy Mike," in 1952 had a yield of 10.4 megatons, and the
  largest ever detonated, the Soviet Union's "Tsar Bomba" in 1961, had a yield of 50 megatons.


### Comparison:

- **Energy Release**: Hydrogen bombs are significantly more powerful than atomic bombs. While atomic bombs release
  energy on the order of kilotons of TNT, hydrogen bombs release energy in the range of megatons of TNT, making them
  hundreds to thousands of times more powerful.
- **Destruction**: The increased yield of hydrogen bombs results in vastly greater destructive power, capable of causing
  more extensive damage over a larger area, along with producing more intense heat and radiation.

In summary, while atomic bombs are devastating weapons, hydrogen bombs represent an order of magnitude greater in
destructive power, due to the additional energy released through nuclear fusion.

Approximately 1,200 to 1,500 thermonuclear or fusion bombs (commonly referred to as hydrogen bombs) have been detonated
since the first test in 1952. These tests were conducted by several countries, including the United States, the Soviet
Union (now Russia), the United Kingdom, France, and China.


### Key Points:

- **United States**: The first hydrogen bomb test, "Ivy Mike," was conducted by the U.S. in 1952. The U.S. continued to
  conduct numerous tests during the Cold War.
- **Soviet Union**: The Soviet Union conducted its first hydrogen bomb test in 1953 with "RDS-6s," and continued testing
  until 1990, including the largest bomb ever detonated, the "Tsar Bomba," in 1961.
- **Other Countries**: The United Kingdom, France, and China also conducted a series of thermonuclear tests during the
  Cold War era.


### Total Tests:

The exact number of thermonuclear bombs tested can vary depending on definitions and classifications, but it is
generally within the range mentioned above. These tests were part of broader nuclear weapons development programs that
included both atomic (fission) and thermonuclear (fusion) devices.


### Modern Context:

After the Cold War, the number of nuclear tests decreased significantly due to international treaties like the Partial
Test Ban Treaty (1963) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (1996), though the latter has not yet entered into
force. Most nuclear-capable nations now rely on computer simulations and subcritical testing to maintain their arsenals,
rather than conducting full-scale nuclear explosions.

In the United States, approximately 200 thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb tests were conducted between 1952 and 1992. These
tests were part of the broader U.S. nuclear weapons testing program, which included a total of 1,054 nuclear tests. The
majority of these hydrogen bomb tests took place at the Nevada Test Site, with some also conducted in the Pacific
Proving Grounds, particularly on islands such as Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll.


### Key Details:

- **First U.S. Thermonuclear Test**: The first U.S. hydrogen bomb test, known as "Ivy Mike," took place on November 1,
  1952, at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It had a yield of 10.4 megatons of TNT.
- **Pacific Tests**: Many of the early and more powerful hydrogen bomb tests were conducted in the Pacific Proving
  Grounds due to the vast, remote ocean areas that could contain the immense power of these devices.
- **Nevada Test Site**: Later tests, especially those conducted underground, were held at the Nevada Test Site. These
  tests were often lower-yield thermonuclear devices designed to be part of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

The U.S. conducted its last full-scale nuclear test, which included both fission and fusion components, in September
1992, before the moratorium on nuclear testing. Since then, the U.S. has relied on subcritical testing and computer
simulations to maintain its nuclear stockpile.
