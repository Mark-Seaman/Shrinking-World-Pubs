# To My Beloved

Oneness is the greatest and most complex mystery in my life.
How is it possible that two people could share one soul, one mind and one heart?
Yet that was our reality.
We were one in every way.

If I were to live multiple lifetime, I would never expect to have the experience that I have had with you.
From our first kiss to your dying breath, you were my world.
Over the decades, we became one!
We shared every aspect of life.

You made up everything I lacked, and I made up everything that you laughed as well.
Together, we were one fantastic team. 
Or really, one amazing person.

When two become one, it is a glorious thing.
But when one is taking away only a half a person remains.
One year ago, I was cut in half and my life ended with yours.
Gradually, I have been learning to grow into wholeness once more.

For the first three months, I learned to function emotionally again.
The next three months were spent developing social skills that had never developed previously.
The third three months were spent learning to cope with the intense pain of loss and lonliness.
And finally, I began to imagine the new life that I desire to live.

This has been the hardest journey of my life.
When I lost you, I lost life: 
my identity, purpose, love, joy, peace, hope, ambition, my past, my present, and my dreams for the future.
Without you I Needed to start over and rethink every element of my life.

Each month brought healing restoration and wholeness.
Gradually, I began to live again.
But it was not the life that I lived before.
That life was gone forever and not possible without you.

Paul tells us that the oneness of a man and a woman is a picture of how God wants to relate to his children.
This is a very appropriate metaphor. But since I cannot really understand 
the mystery of oneness with us, it remains a mystery how God relates to his people.
I experienced that even though I never truly understood it.
Of all the couples that I have ever known, we were the closest to being truly one.

Over the years, I grew to understand that when you spoke to me, you spoke with God's voice.
Now, when God speaks to me, he speaks with yours.
I don't really understand this, but believe it to be true.

Is it you speaking to me from beyond the grave 
or is it simply echoes of the wisdom that you spoke into my life? 
Is it just the spirit of God whispering in my imagination? 
Does it really matter?

All I know is that there is a still small voice that speaks to me constantly. 
It sounds a lot like your voice.
It is a voice of wisdom, love, and encouragement.
I receive it as a gift from God to leading guide me through the dark places that I walk.

I am grateful for the oneness that we shared.
I am grateful for the oneness that we still share.
Whether it is memory or imagination or the spirit of God, 
I am grateful for the voice that speaks to me.

It has been a year now, and I am feeling whole once again.
But our family is suffering badly.
I pray for each one constantly.
We are somewhat lost without your leadership and care.

You saw every person as a unique individual.
You spoke the words of God for encouragement and life.
You cared deeply about each of us.
We need your light and your wisdom now more than ever.

I am often overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for our family.
God regularly spoke to both of us About how much more he love the kids than we ever could.
I believe that and trust him to care for them.
