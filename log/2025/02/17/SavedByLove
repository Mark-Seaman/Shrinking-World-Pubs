Saved by Love

My childhood left me emotionally crippled—trapped in despair, isolation, and fear. I grew up believing that relationships were a threat, that closeness led to pain, and that I was destined for a life of loneliness. But God had a different plan. They say believers are “Jesus with skin on,” and in my life, that was Stacie.

We met when we were just 15, both carrying the weight of life’s early lessons. I was deeply wounded, desperate for something I couldn’t even name—unconditional love. And through Stacie, I found it. For the first time, I felt seen, valued, and cherished without conditions. Her love didn’t just comfort me; it transformed me.

Looking back, I now see that she was a channel for God’s love. It wasn’t just Stacie—it was God working through her, reaching into the broken places of my heart. She showed me that love wasn’t something I had to earn through perfection or performance. It was a gift, freely given. Her presence taught me that closeness could bring comfort, not danger, and slowly, the walls I had built around my heart began to crumble.

By the time we married four years later, we had built a soul connection—one deeply rooted in unconditional love between Stacie, me, and God. Our bond was unbreakable, not because life was easy, but because it was anchored in divine love.

Stacie didn’t just love me; she saved me. But it wasn’t just her—it was God’s love through her that altered my destiny. She showed me that even the deepest wounds could be redeemed. Her influence healed parts of me I didn’t even know were broken.

Because of Stacie, I learned that love—real, unconditional love—has the power to transform, to heal, and to rewrite even the most painful stories. I am not who I once was, and I owe that to the love that first saved me—God’s love, given through the heart of a girl who saw past my wounds and loved me anyway.
