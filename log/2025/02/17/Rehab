A Month of Psychological Rehab

When an alcoholic hits rock bottom, they often seek rehab as a turning point in their lives. In late January, I recognized that I needed something just as intense—an immersive psychological rehabilitation—to confront the traumas that were holding me back. I dedicated the month of February to this process, committing fully to personal transformation.

To guide me through this journey, I enlisted four counselors, each offering a unique perspective to help me navigate the complexities of my past and future. Now, at the midpoint of this experience, I am astounded by the profound insights I have gained in just two weeks—more than I have ever experienced in such a short time.

The first week was dedicated to understanding how my childhood shaped my present reality. I uncovered the deep-seated trauma that contributed to lifelong dysfunction, but I also recognized the profound healing influence of my late wife, Stacie. Her love and presence played a crucial role in my journey toward wholeness.

The second week focused on identity. For the past year, I struggled to envision the life I wanted to live and the person I aspired to become. Now, I have clarity: my life is centered around three main goals—to live well, to love well, and to create something of beauty every day. Defining these principles has been exhilarating, allowing me to picture a future where I don’t just survive but thrive.

This journey is far from over, but for the first time in a long time, I feel truly alive.

Let me know if you would like any further details about my journey so far.  I am happy to share them with people I trust.
