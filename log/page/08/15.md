# My Travels in Greece

Traveling to Greece has been a recurring and transformative experience, marking each significant phase of my life. Every
visit has deepened my perspective, from the wide-eyed wonder of childhood to the reflective gaze of old age.

In 1969, as a ten-year-old, Greece was a land of magic and mystery. Living in Athens and attending an American school, I
explored the city with childlike curiosity. Despite the tension of military rule, the warmth of Greek Easter on Crete,
with its vibrant traditions and the aroma of roasting lamb, left an indelible mark on my young heart.

Returning in 1999, at age 40, Greece became a pilgrimage. Walking in the footsteps of the apostle Paul, I revisited the land
through the lens of an adult. The country had changed, and so had I, but Greeceâ€™s timeless beauty remained, enriching my
worldview.

By 2009, at 50, Greece was a familiar yet always exciting destination. Ocean cruises through the Greek Islands offered a
leisurely pace to savor the azure waters and whitewashed buildings. Athens and Nauplio, with their blend of history and
modern vibrancy, became treasured memories, highlighted by discovering a favorite restaurant beneath the Acropolis.

Now, at age 65, in 2024, I prepare for another journey to Greece, one of reflection and reconnection. With old friends
by my side, I will walk the ancient paths once more, finding inspiration in the land that has always been a constant
thread in the tapestry of my life.
