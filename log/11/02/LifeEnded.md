# When My Life Ended

I had built a life I was proud of. My journey revolved around three guiding principles: living out my unique personality
and strengths, loving my family deeply, and walking a path of simple discipleship.

For much of my life, these goals had been fulfilled. I had succeeded in ways I never thought possible and had arrived at
a season of celebration and reflection. I expected the next 20 years to be a time to deepen my understanding and bring personal
transformation.  I was ready to embrace the future with joy and anticipation.  I never imagined that my life would take a
dramatic turn, leading me to a place of deep sorrow and loss.


## The Crisis

My 64th birthday, on September 1, 2023, marked the beginning of an unexpected upheaval. Over the next 120 days, I lost
everything that mattered, except for my children and grandchildren. My world was shattered.

Stacie and I had allowed ourselves to become severely overcommitted, juggling five demanding careers between us. By my
birthday, we were in crisis — emotionally and physically exhausted, with barely any time left for joy or family. We had
canceled three vacations, working 60-hour weeks and rarely enjoying life. Our lives had devolved into a cycle of work,
sleep, and work again. We were ready to break free and live the life we had always dreamed of. 

In late September, we resolved to change. We committed to officially retiring and seeking a life of leisure and
enjoyment, cherishing time together. Though we still had obligations through December, we looked forward to letting go
of all future commitments and focusing only on what brought us joy.
But we never got the chance.


## Life Takes a Turn

But in early October, Stacie became ill. Three weeks passed as we searched for answers. On Halloween, we saw the images of the
tumors that had begun to consume her body.

Six weeks later, she was gone. It happened so quickly that none of us had the chance to fully understand or process it.
In November, our lives were consumed by medical appointments, holding onto hope while knowing we were only treading
water.  Every day in December, we watched her slip away, knowing that the end was near.


## Death and Desolation

We all know, in theory, that death will come, but it always feels distant until it arrives. Even when faced with grim
realities, we cling to hope.

On December 13, Stacie passed into eternity, and I was left alone, deep in the shadow of death. My life as I knew it was
over; every part of my world had her fingerprints. I could not imagine living that life without her.

For a couple of weeks, I was lost. But eventually, I understood that I would have to start anew. January 1, 2024, marked
the beginning of my new life, and over the following months, I walked through grief, emerging slowly from that dark
valley.


## Reliving the Calendar

September, October, November, December 2024. These months mark the worst days of my life, the 120 days when my old life
disintegrated, leaving a void where my future was supposed to be.

Now, a year later, I am halfway through these same months, painfully aware of where I was one year ago. Each day brings
reminders of those dark moments and what was lost.  

- In September, we decided to retire.
- October brought Stacie's illness.
- November was filled with our desperate search for a solution.
- December, the month we lost the battle, began my life without her.


## Recovery

In the year since, I’ve been on a journey of healing and transformation. I’m healthier and, in some ways, happier than
I’ve ever been, yet the pain of loss lingers as I watch those dates roll by on the calendar. I remember every
detail — where we were, what we hoped for, and what we feared.

I'm through September and October, but November and December are still ahead. I know they will be hard, but I am
determined to face them with courage and hope. I am not the same person I was a year ago, and I am ready to face the
pain and the memories with a new perspective.
The coming months will be challenging, but I am comforted by the incredible support and connection I feel with others. I
am surrounded by people who bring encouragement, helping me find strength to move forward.
