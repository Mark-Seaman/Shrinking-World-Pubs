Dear Mark,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks for the trip to Greece that
you so thoughtfully organized. Your kindness and generosity in making it happen were truly a gift, and it meant more to
me than words can express.

This journey came at a pivotal time in my life, providing a much-needed space for healing and reflection and laughter.
The experiences a brought moments of joy but also played a crucial role in my journey toward emotional restoration. The
memories made and the shared laughter were more than a vacation; they were steps toward reclaiming a sense of peace and
reimagining my life moving forward.

To further share the depth of my appreciation and the impact the trip had on me, I’ve written an article which is part
of my life story, [“The Four Quests”](https://markseaman.org/quest). I hope reading it conveys just how profound this
journey was for me and how your support contributed to this important chapter of my healing.

You can find the article here: [“A Journey into Joy”](https://markseaman.org/quest/Joy.md).

Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and for being a part of my path to renewal. I’m so grateful for your generosity
and the joy it brought into my life.

With deep gratitude,

Mark Seaman
