# When Will We Feel Safe?

In the aftermath of World War II, the world stood witness to the terrifying power of nuclear weapons. The 14-kiloton
bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 claimed the lives of over 140,000 people — instantly and in the days that followed. The
explosion leveled a city, burned its people, and left a shadow of its former self. Yet, less than two decades later, in
1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, a monstrous 50-megaton bomb — 3,571 times more powerful than the one used on
Hiroshima. While Tsar Bomba was tested in a remote area and spared human life, its destructive force was so great that
had it been detonated over a major city, the death toll would have been incomprehensible.

The question arises: **How did humanity leap from the devastation of Hiroshima to developing a bomb thousands of times
more powerful?** The answer lies in a Cold War doctrine known as *Mutually Assured Destruction* (MAD).


### The Logic Behind MAD

MAD is based on a simple yet terrifying premise: the best way to deter an enemy from launching a nuclear attack is to
ensure that the retaliation would be so catastrophic that no side could claim victory. Under MAD, the mere threat of
total annihilation is supposed to prevent any nation from pressing the button. But paradoxically, this logic has driven
an arms race that seems mad in its own right. If your enemy has 100 nuclear warheads, you need 200. If they develop the
capability to destroy your major cities, you must develop the ability to destroy their entire country—and then some.

As a result, we have continuously sought bigger, more powerful bombs, despite the fact that even the smallest nuclear
weapons can cause mass devastation. Tsar Bomba, for example, was so large that its shockwave circled the Earth three
times, and its flash was visible 1,000 kilometers away. It was overkill on an unimaginable scale, yet the arms race
continued.


### A Grim Comparison

Both the US and Russians have detonated 10-megaton bombs (800 times more power than at Hiroshima).  These are capable of
claiming the lives of millions of men, women, and children instantly and making the city uninhabitable for decades.
There can be no moral justification for such weapons.
There is no repair for this kind of devestation.

To put things into perspective, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima caused a massive loss of life, but it pales in comparison
to what Tsar Bomba could have done. While the Hiroshima bomb killed tens of thousands in an instant, Tsar Bomba,
detonated over a densely populated area, could have easily wiped out millions. Both bombs serve as grim reminders of
humanity's capability for destruction, yet the magnitude of their power highlights the irrationality of our pursuit for
ever-bigger weapons.

The comparison between these two bombs invites an important question: **How many people must die for us to feel
secure?** Hiroshima’s death toll was already unimaginable — do we need to entertain the possibility of wiping entire
nations off the map to feel safe?



### The Madness of Escalation

As nations developed nuclear arsenals capable of destroying the human race many times over, the world entered a
dangerous stalemate. Instead of ensuring peace, this arms race has created a perpetual state of tension, where safety is
defined not by the absence of threats but by the threat of mutual extinction. The drive for bigger and more devastating
bombs seems less about security and more about proving dominance, a twisted show of power where the only winner is
destruction itself.

At its core, the question remains: **How big of a death toll do we really need to feel safe?**  We are on a path of
fulled by MADness, where the pursuit of security has led us to the brink of self-annihilation.  There will eventually be
a day when every weapon is used, and the world will be left in ruins.  I hope I am not around to see that day.


### Conclusion

Nuclear weapons were born from the desire to end a war, but their legacy has been one of fear, escalation, and the
terrifying prospect of annihilation. With weapons capable of wiping out the human race many times over, the notion of
safety feels as hollow as the craters these bombs leave behind. Perhaps the real safety lies not in building bigger
bombs but in asking ourselves when, and if, we will ever stop. 

**When will we feel safe?**
