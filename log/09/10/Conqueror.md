#  The Conqueror Movie Set

There was an incident related to the filming of the movie *The Conqueror* in 1954, which starred John Wayne, Susan
Hayward, and Agnes Moorehead, among others. The film was shot in St. George, Utah, which was downwind of the Nevada Test
Site, where numerous nuclear tests had been conducted.

### Key Details:

- **Film**: *The Conqueror* (1956)
- **Location**: Filmed near St. George, Utah, and on location in Nevada.
- **Nuclear Fallout Exposure**: The area around St. George was exposed to radioactive fallout from nuclear tests at the
  Nevada Test Site, particularly from tests like the "Harry" test (part of Operation Upshot-Knothole) in 1953, which was
  one of the dirtiest tests in terms of radioactive fallout.
- **Health Impact**: Over the years, a significant number of the cast and crew, including John Wayne, Susan Hayward,
  Agnes Moorehead, and director Dick Powell, developed cancer. While it's difficult to prove a direct link between the
  fallout and the cancer cases, the high number of cancer diagnoses among those involved in the film led to speculation
  that radiation exposure might have been a contributing factor. By some estimates, out of the 220 cast and crew
  members, around 91 developed cancer, and 46 died from it.
- **Legacy**: The filming of *The Conqueror* in such a hazardous environment is often cited as an example of the
  unintended consequences of nuclear testing and the lack of awareness at the time about the dangers of radiation
  exposure. The film itself was not well-received, but it has become infamous due to the tragic fate of many of its
  participants.

This story has contributed to the broader narrative about the risks of nuclear testing and the long-term effects of
radioactive fallout on human health.
