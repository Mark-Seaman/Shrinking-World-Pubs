# In the Shadow of the Nuclear Arms Race

I've been writing a lot about my life and the effects of the Nuclear Arms Race on it.  I'm doing a great deal of
research and combining my personal experiences.  There is an amazing amount of material on the internet and ChatGPT is
helping me put the entire story together.  I'm looking forward to sharing it with you.
