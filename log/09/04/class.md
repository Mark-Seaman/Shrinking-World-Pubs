# Class Notes  - 9-4-2024

## Matt's Loss

* Matt Swaffer was a great teacher and my friend .
* We have been working hard to reduce the impact of his loss.
* I think we have a good plan in place.
* Mimimize the impact on the students.

## BACS 350 History

* I started teaching BACS 350 7 years ago.
* I switched from PHP/MySQL to Python/Django 5 years ago
* Over the last few years, I have been tuning the course content to optimize the student experience.
* I retired in December from UNC to focus on teaching online.
* Two day ago I agreed to teach BACS 350 at UNC again.

## Minimize the Student Impact

* We had to make some difficult decisions on changes to the course.
* Matt was teaching the course based on React.JS.
* We could not afford the delay to bring on all new teaching materials.
* We will be utilizing the teaching materials that were used last Fall.
* We are switching back to Python/Django/PostGres for the course.
* This will be disrupptive to the students but less so than creating a new course.
* You deserve the best course that we can deliver.

## Course Schedule

* React.JS is a great technology and you will get value from the textbook.
* We will be restarting the class in Week 2.
* We will push the schedule back by one week, and remove the last week of the course.
* We will be using the same textbook and materials that were used last Fall.
* The technology stack will be Python, Django, and PostGres deployed at Digital Ocean.
* We will be using the same assignments and projects that were used last Fall.

## Course Structure

* Each week we will have ...
    * A Project that is due on Friday
    * Two videos will teach the skills needed for the project (pause and do as you watch)
    * "Building Python Web Apps" is an online textbook to fill in any gaps
    * Extensive office hourse to help you with your projects
* Grading will be based on the projects and videos that you complete.
    * Each project is pass/fail.
    * There are 13 projects and 13 weeks of videos.
    * You will register the URL for Github repo in order to get credit for each project.
    * Go at your own pace, but keep up with the weekly schedule.
* A web site will guide you through each week of the course.

## Office Hours

I've blocked out 2 hours daily M-F to schedule office hours.

This time will let you get help on completing your projects.

We'll meet with video and you will share your screen and show me what is going on and we'll troubleshoot the problem.

Book your 15 minute time block off my calendar which show the available times.
