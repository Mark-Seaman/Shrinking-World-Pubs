Unexpected return to teaching


It is my first day back, after my retirement. I retired from teaching at the University of Northern Colorado in December after seven years. I had been teaching at the Monfort College of Business, Web Development, and Software Engineering. It was time to retire and build my Shrinking World Academy online school.

I had billed classes while at UNC and I had included these in the online school. When I retired, I worked with UNC to transition the courses that I was teaching and provide them with the materials that I had created. I celebrated the accomplishments of my time at UNC where I had written three textbooks and built three classes with the course curriculum. These classes were very successful and I was feeling very satisfied with what I had accomplished for the students.

I had been teaching in the fall and this fall was the first time that my web development class was taught by another professor. On Labor Day, just one week into class, I was notified that the new professor had unexpectedly died, creating a huge need. The students were already one week into the class and it was unsure how they would proceed.


Preparing for Class


I first got the notification of the professor's death by text at 7 o'clock in the morning on Labor Day. And by the following morning, I had accepted the challenge of returning to the classroom.

Tuesday was spent feverishly getting ready to deliver the transition for the class, which would occur Wednesday afternoon. At UNC, we use a learning management system called Canvas, and this system holds all of the assignments, the grade book, the student roster, and provides a communication platform between teachers and students. It requires a great deal of setup, but I already had a full instantiation of the course that I offered last fall. So I was able to greatly accelerate the setup in Canvas by importing all of the materials that I had from the previous semester.

Then I needed to adjust the curriculum to meet the new schedule and calendar and make adjustments to the syllabus to reflect the new changes that would have to be applied. I worked feverishly and into the night to be ready for the first class on Wednesday.

I met with the students and talked over the new plan for the class, and we would restart the curriculum one week into the class. So this meant that we had really only had two class sessions that we had to reset. So I delayed the course curriculum by one week and eliminated the last week of the original course since that was the least valuable material for the students.


Course History


I had taught BACS 350 for seven years, and this class represented the highlight of my teaching career at UNC. The class was Business Administration - Computer Science: Intermediate Web Development. My goal was to produce a class that would allow every student enough skill to be able to get a job as a professional software developer. This is a tall order for a single class, but I had achieved it over a period of years.

I rewrote the class five years ago to teach new technology from my predecessor, and every year I continued to optimize the class so that it became more practical, more hands-on, and the students would become more successful. I achieved these goals and was able to leverage that material, which also became a flagship product for the Shrinking World Academy, my online school.


Engaging with Students


I was excited to see several students from the class I had previously taught on software engineering. I was able to communicate the transition plan and course objectives, and the students responded positively to the goals that I had set for the course.

One of the big challenges for students these days is that many of their college classes don't really produce marketable skills. They may give background information that is very valuable, but this class in particular is geared toward allowing students to work professionally. My goal has always been that every student that succeeds at this class would be able to get hired. I've run a software business for 12 years, and my goal has always been to train someone that I would be willing to hire to work in my company. And this course has been carefully optimized to produce that result.

I would identify BACS 350 as the high point of my teaching. I cannot think of anything that I've done in teaching that is more important. And I was surprised to understand how much I needed to contribute to the success of others. This has been something that has always been important to me. And after retiring, I felt a lack of opportunity to truly make a difference. And suddenly I was back in the classroom making a difference with the course that is the most valuable thing that I can offer. So this has truly been an answer to a dream for me, but under tragic circumstances that no one could have foreseen.
