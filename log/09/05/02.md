# Preparing for Class

It was early on Labor Day morning, when I first received the news. A text message informed me of the tragic
passing of the professor who had taken over my Web Development class. By the next morning, I had accepted the unexpected
challenge of stepping back into the classroom to ensure the students' learning experience continued without disruption.

Tuesday was a whirlwind of preparation. I needed to get everything in place for the Wednesday afternoon class. UNC uses
Canvas, a learning management system that stores all the course materials, assignments, the grade book, and provides a
communication platform between teachers and students. The system requires significant setup, but thankfully, I had
taught this course last fall. This allowed me to accelerate the process by importing all the materials from the previous
semester, saving me valuable time. 

The next hurdle was adjusting the curriculum to fit the new timeline. I had to modify the syllabus, ensuring it aligned
with the current academic calendar and made sense for the students. I worked late into the night, making the necessary
adjustments so everything would be ready for Wednesdayâ€™s class.

When I finally met with the students, I explained the situation and presented the revised plan. We would effectively
restart the course from the beginning, just one week in. Fortunately, this only required resetting two class sessions. I
delayed the curriculum by a week and removed the final week's content, which was less essential for the students.
