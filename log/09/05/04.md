# Engaging with Students

Stepping back into the classroom, I was thrilled to see several familiar faces from my previous Software Engineering
course. These students were already familiar with my teaching style, and I quickly communicated the transition plan and
course objectives. Their positive response to the goals I had set for this Web Development course was reassuring and
invigorating.

One of the biggest challenges students face today is the gap between academic theory and real-world, marketable skills.
Many college courses provide valuable background knowledge, but they often fall short in preparing students for
immediate professional opportunities. This class, however, is different. My focus has always been to ensure that every
student who succeeds in this course leaves with the skills necessary to be hired as a professional developer. Having run
a software business for 12 years, I designed the course with the mindset that I would be willing to hire any student who
excelled in it. Over the years, I optimized the curriculum to align with real-world demands and produce that very
result.

Looking back, I consider "Intermediate Web Development" the pinnacle of my teaching career. Nothing else I’ve done in
education feels as significant or impactful. When I retired, I didn’t anticipate how much I would miss the opportunity
to contribute to others' success. Returning to the classroom unexpectedly has rekindled that sense of purpose. While the
circumstances that brought me back were tragic, this opportunity to make a difference again feels like a true blessing,
one that I didn’t realize I needed.
