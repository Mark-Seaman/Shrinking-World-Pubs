# Course History

For seven years, I had the privilege of teaching BACS 350 at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC), a course that
quickly became the highlight of my teaching career. BACS 350, officially titled Business Administration - Computer
Science: Intermediate Web Development, was designed with a clear and ambitious goal: to equip every student with the
skills necessary to secure a job as a professional software developer. This was no small task for a single course, but
through years of refinement, I made it a reality.

Five years ago, I undertook the significant challenge of completely rewriting the course to incorporate the latest web
development technologies, building upon the work of my predecessor. This overhaul marked a turning point, and from that
moment on, I focused on optimizing the course year after year. I shifted towards a more practical, hands-on approach
that would empower students to apply what they learned in real-world scenarios. With each iteration, the course became
more effective, and I saw my students thrive in the fast-evolving world of web development.

BACS 350 became more than just a class â€” it was a launching pad for the next generation of developers. When I retired
from UNC, I was able to utilize the curriculum as one of the flagship offerings in my online school, Shrinking World
Academy. I hope that this course, which had evolved into a true gem over the years, continues to make an impact far
beyond the university walls.

This course took an enormous amount of effort to develop and refine, but the results were more than worth it. I was
finally able to achieve my goal of delivering highly valued skills to students without having to have a teacher present.
Everything is available online and students can watch videos, read the textbook, and get step by step instructions to
complete the 14 projects.  This is the crowning achievement of my teaching career.  I am so proud of what I have
accomplished.
