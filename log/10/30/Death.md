# A Journey into Death

For nearly 45 years, I had been happily married to Stacie. Our lives were intertwined in every way, and much of my
identity was bound up in our shared dreams and moments. Then, in an instant, she was gone. I was shattered. Stacie’s
passing plunged me into an abyss I hadn’t known existed—a realm of grief and emptiness that redefined everything I once
held as certain.

In the weeks following her death, I found myself grappling with a painful new reality. I had lost the woman I had built
my life around, and the depth of that loss was overwhelming. This was my first journey—the journey into death and
survival. The valley of the shadow of death was no longer an abstract concept from Psalm 23; I was walking it step by
step, feeling the darkness, yet also searching for the comfort promised in those words.  

Over the course of the first three months of my new life, I clung to my faith, finding solace in the idea that God was
there with me, guiding me through this desolate landscape. I wrote daily, each word a small victory against despair. By
the time I reached the 90-day mark, I realized that these writings had begun to coalesce into a narrative of survival
and healing—a journey that I later compiled into what would become *The Life After Death Handbook.* 

It was both a
personal catharsis and, I hoped, a source of comfort for others facing similar losses. I had begun to see glimmers of
peace, knowing that while life would never be the same, it would continue.
