# A Journey into Joy

The final journey this year was one I never anticipated: a journey back into joy. For months, I had been defined by my
grief, feeling as though I had become a “grief walker.” All my relationships, all my conversations seemed to orbit
around this central loss, and while I was healing, I found myself yearning for more. I longed for a life that wasn’t
solely marked by sorrow—a life with friends, hobbies, laughter, and conversations unshadowed by grief. I wanted to
rediscover the things that had once brought me joy: teaching, writing, creating.

A glimmer of hope came when I signed up for a “Journeys of Paul” tour through Greece, following in the footsteps of my
father, who had taken a similar trip decades ago. What began as an educational trip quickly became an awakening. I
encountered deep friendships and found myself laughing, sharing, and connecting on a level I hadn’t anticipated. The
laughter, the camaraderie — it was all a powerful reminder that there was still life to be lived. I began to see my future
with fresh eyes, realizing that life wasn’t over, that there were new beginnings waiting for me.

This journey reignited my passions, reminding me that while my story has shifted, it hasn’t ended. There are still pages
left to be written, still adventures to embark upon. The journey into joy wasn’t just a trip to Greece; it was a
homecoming to myself, a rediscovery of the man I once was, and a hopeful step toward the man I am still becoming. 

In these journeys of the heart, I’ve found strength, connection, and perhaps most unexpectedly, joy. Life will never be
the same, but I am learning that maybe, just maybe, it can be beautiful again in a new way.
