# A Journey into Sorrow

Six months after Stacie’s passing, I felt a deep need to return to the place where our life together had begun:
Flagstaff, Arizona. This was where we’d grown up, fallen in love, and started our family. Arizona was more than just a
state; it was the bedrock of our shared history, and I knew I needed to confront those memories face-to-face.

With my daughter by my side, I revisited places that held echoes of our life together: our childhood homes, schools,
hangouts. I even attended a high school reunion, an event that exposed me to the shocking reality of loss on a much
larger scale. The nuclear fallout from testing in the 1960s had affected Flagstaff profoundly, and I discovered that
Stacie was one of hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community impacted by this tragedy. Many of my classmates
had also lost loved ones, victims of this senseless devastation.

The weight of this realization nearly broke me. I was not only grieving my own loss but grappling with the knowledge
that this tragedy had been multiplied across an entire community. I found myself awash in sorrow and anger, grappling
with questions of fairness and fate. In time, I came to a place of acceptance. Some losses defy understanding, and
perhaps all we can do is honor the lives touched by them. This journey into sorrow was necessary, allowing me to find a
deeper, more resilient peace.
