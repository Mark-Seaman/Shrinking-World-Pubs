# A year of Transformation

As a writer, I am always drawn to stories, both those around me and within me. This past year has been a story like no
other—a narrative woven from grief, discovery, reconnection, and, perhaps most surprisingly, joy. I embarked on four
journeys, each one unplanned, each one life-altering. These weren’t mere travels but profound passages of the heart.
They have reshaped me, leaving me with a new understanding of both loss and life itself. 

These four journeys are what I call the "Journeys of the Heart." Each of them has forever marked my life, creating
definitive “before” and “after” moments.  I did not choose any of these journeys, but was surprised by each one.
Completing the journey required self-awareness, humility, and courage.  At the end of each journey I realized that the
path I had taken was entirely necessary for me.

For the past five years I have been on a Quest for Understanding.  When I turned 60 my life seemed to change and I
entered a new season.  My mid-life years were characterized by the Quest for Purpose.  Most of my energy was spent
trying to gain influence so that I could make the world a better place.  But the world melted down around me in 2020,
with the pandemic and political insanity that cause our society to fragment.

I no longer believed that it was possible to make a difference in the way that I had for my entire life.  I realized
that I had very little control over the major issues that affected my everyday life.  And so began my Quest for
Understanding.  I wanted to know what I could control and learn to be at peace with all of the aspects of reality that I
could not control.

At the heart of this quest lies the reality that I can only control me (what I do, what I say, what I think, and what I
feel).  I do not control anyone else.  This has allowed me to focus my energy on what I control and let everything else
go.

After my wife died last year, everything that I had counted on had to be reevaluated and reassessed.  Every belief and
value that had served me was now scrutinized.  The four journeys that I went on this year brought me through the
greatest transformation that I have ever experienced. This overall journey has changed me in ways that I didn't know
were possible.
