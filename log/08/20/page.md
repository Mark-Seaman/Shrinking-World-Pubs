# Getting Started

### Register at OpenAI

Stepping into the world of AI might feel overwhelming, but with a little guidance, you’ll be up and running in no time. In your first hour, start by setting up an account at [OpenAI](https://OpenAI.com). The process is simple—just an email and password, and you can be using AI in under a minute!

### Beyond a Search Engine

It’s important to understand that AI isn’t just a search engine. While Google retrieves web pages based on keywords, AI goes beyond that. It uses its vast understanding of published material to solve problems and provide answers. Think of it as having a conversation with a knowledgeable friend who has digested the entire internet. Your prompts guide the AI in providing tailored responses, making your interaction as relevant and helpful as possible.

### AI Playbook

Just as a coach needs a playbook to navigate a game, you need a strategy for using AI effectively. This playbook introduces you to AI’s capabilities, helping you get the most out of your experience. As you explore, you’ll discover new ways AI can assist with both work and play, making your interactions more efficient and enjoyable. Start with prompts from this playbook and gradually build your own, tailoring them to your needs. This approach will help you harness AI’s full potential.
