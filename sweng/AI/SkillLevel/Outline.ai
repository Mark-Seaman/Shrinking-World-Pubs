# Skill Level

Learning a skill is an exponential effort.  
There are five levels of experience.  

Skills levels: L1-Novice, L2-Beginner, L3-Competent, L4-Proficient, L5-Expert

To get to level 5 requires 10000 hours. 

Create a formula that shows the effort required for each level of skill.

    Experience = (10 ^ Skill_level) Hours of Practice

Skills levels: L1-Novice, L2-Beginner, L3-Competent, L4-Proficient, 5L-Expert

Project Effort Required: L1-2000 hours, L3-500 hours, L5-100

Skill Level 1 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 1) = 1 hour
Skill Level 2 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 2) = 10 hours
Skill Level 3 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 3) = 100 hours
Skill Level 4 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 4) = 1000 hours
Skill Level 5 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 5) = 10000 hours

Experience = (10 ^ Skill_level) Hours of Practice


Create a CSV text block with each row being the Skill Level at the beginning of the project.
Column one is the skill level.
Column two is the number of hours of practice to gain the skill level.

    Skill Level,Hours of Practice to Gain Skill Level
    1,1
    2,10
    3,100
    4,1000
    5,10000

Add a column to show to skill level after the hours in column 2.

Show the Skill Level over the course of 20000 hours of practice.

Productivity

Work Units/Hour

* Level 1 = 1 unit/hours
* Level 2 = 2 unit/hours
* Level 3 = 4 unit/hours
* Level 4 = 8 unit/hours
* Level 5 = 16 unit/hours

Productivity is measured in Units/Hours of effort.

Calculate a formula for productivity (units/hour)

    P(S) = 2^(S-1)

Create a CSV text block with each row being the Skill Level at the beginning of the project.
Column one is the skill level.
Column two is Productivity

    Skill Level,Productivity (Units/Hours of Effort)
    1,1 unit per hour
    2,2 units per hour
    3,4 units per hour
    4,8 units per hour
    5,16 units per hour

Each level is achieved by gaining experience

    Experience = (10 ^ Skill_level) Hours of Practice

Add a column showing the experience required


---

As Effort is spent the skill level increases at the following rate.

Skill Level 1 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 1) = 1 hour
Skill Level 2 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 2) = 10 hours
Skill Level 3 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 3) = 100 hours
Skill Level 4 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 4) = 1000 hours
Skill Level 5 = 0.1 * (10 ^ 5) = 10000 hours

---

Create a CSV text block with each row being the Skill Level at the beginning of the project.


Column two contains the Effort Assuming that learning occurs from the project experience.
