    Quantified Learning
        Novice - 100% learning
        Beginner - 50% learning
        Competent - 25% learning
        Proficient - 12% learning
        Expert - 6% learning
    Each new task has a required base of learning
    Half-life of required learning
    Like a debt that must be paid
    Productivity is the Doing (after the learning)
