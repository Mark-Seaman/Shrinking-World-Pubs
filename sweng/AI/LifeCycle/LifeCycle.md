# Software Development Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that describes the phases and activities
involved in software development. The SDLC typically consists of six phases:

**Requirements**: This phase involves gathering and analyzing the
requirements of the software system to be developed. Requirements can be functional (what the
software system should do) or non-functional (how the software system should perform).

**Design**: In this phase, the software system's architecture and design are developed based on the
requirements. Design involves defining the software components, their interactions, and the
data structures and algorithms used.

**Code**: In this phase, the software system is developed using programming languages,
software libraries, and frameworks. The implementation phase involves coding, debugging, and
testing the software system.

**Test**: In this phase, the software system is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements
and performs as expected. Testing can be done at different levels, including unit testing,
integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

**Deployment**: In this phase, the software system is released and installed on the target platform.
Deployment involves configuring the software system, installing it on the target machines, and
providing user training and support.

**Maintenance**: In this phase, the software system is maintained and evolved over time. Maintenance
can involve fixing bugs, adding new features, improving performance, and adapting the software
system to new requirements and technologies.


### Software Process Models

A software process model is a framework that describes the activities involved in software
development and the order in which they occur. Process models provide a structured approach to
software development, enabling software developers to plan and manage the software development
process effectively. There are various software process models, including the waterfall model,
iterative model, and agile model.

The waterfall model is a sequential software development process that follows a linear and rigid
approach. The iterative model is a software development process that involves repeating a series of
steps until a satisfactory software product is developed. The agile model is a software development
process that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid prototyping.

In conclusion, this chapter provided an overview of software engineering, the software development
life cycle, software requirements, and software process models. The next chapter will focus on
software design, which involves creating software architectures, modules, and components that meet
user needs and organizational goals.
