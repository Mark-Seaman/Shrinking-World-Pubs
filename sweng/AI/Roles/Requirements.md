### Software Requirements

Software Requirements are the foundation of software development. Requirements define what the
software system should do and how it should behave. Requirements can be classified into different
types, including functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and domain requirements.

Functional requirements describe the software system's behavior and functionality, such as user
interfaces, data processing, and business rules. Non-functional requirements describe the software
system's quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, usability, and security. Domain
requirements describe the specific characteristics of the application domain, such as regulations,
standards, and best practices.

Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and
managing requirements. Requirements engineering involves collaboration between stakeholders, such
as users, customers, developers, and testers. Conclusion

Requirements engineering is an essential aspect of software engineering because it lays the
foundation for the entire software development process. Poorly defined requirements can lead to
software products that do not meet user needs, are unreliable, and difficult to maintain.
Therefore, requirements engineering must be done carefully, and software requirements must be
documented, validated, and verified throughout the software development life cycle.
