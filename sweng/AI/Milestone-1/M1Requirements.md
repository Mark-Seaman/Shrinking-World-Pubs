# AI Playbook: Requirements - Milestone 1

## Deliverable 1: Project Charter

The project charter is a document that outlines the objectives, scope, and stakeholders of the
project. It provides a high-level overview of the project, including its purpose and the desired
outcomes. The project charter sets the foundation for the requirements gathering process by clearly
defining the project's goals and the key stakeholders involved.

## Deliverable 2: Stakeholder Analysis

Stakeholder analysis involves assessing the individuals or groups impacted by the project and
understanding their specific needs and expectations. This analysis helps identify the key
stakeholders who should be involved in the requirements gathering process. It allows for a deeper
understanding of the stakeholder's perspectives, priorities, and potential conflicts. The
stakeholder analysis ensures that the requirements gathered align with the needs and expectations
of all relevant parties.

## Deliverable 3: Requirements Management Plan

The requirements management plan outlines the strategy for capturing, documenting, and managing
project requirements throughout the project lifecycle. It defines the roles and responsibilities of
the team members involved in requirements gathering and establishes the processes and procedures
for effective requirements management. The plan includes guidelines for requirement prioritization,
traceability, validation, and change management. It ensures that the requirements gathering process
is well-organized and structured.

## Deliverable 4: Requirement Gathering Techniques

Requirement gathering techniques are a selection of methods used to collect requirements from
stakeholders. These techniques include interviews, surveys, and workshops, among others. The
objective is to engage stakeholders in meaningful discussions to elicit their needs, preferences,
and constraints. The choice of requirement gathering techniques depends on the project's nature,
the characteristics of the stakeholders, and the desired level of detail. These techniques enable
the project team to gather comprehensive and accurate requirements for the successful
implementation of the project.
