### 16 Development Criteria to Pass Milestone 1: Project Charter

Milestone 1 of a software development project is crucial as it lays the foundation for the entire project. To successfully pass this milestone, there are 16 key development criteria that need to be met. These criteria are divided among the roles of the project manager, designer, programmer, and QA engineer.

#### Project Manager Responsibilities
1. Define project goals and objectives: The project manager must clearly articulate the purpose and desired outcomes of the project.
2. Define project scope and deliverables: The project manager needs to establish the boundaries and specific deliverables of the project.
3. Identify project stakeholders: Identifying all stakeholders involved in the project is essential for effective communication and collaboration.
4. Develop project timeline and budget: The project manager should create a timeline that outlines the project's milestones and a budget that outlines the estimated costs.

#### Designer Responsibilities
5. Conduct user research and analysis: The designer must conduct thorough research to understand the needs and preferences of the target users.
6. Create wireframes and prototypes: Building wireframes and prototypes allows designers to visualize and test different design ideas.
7. Develop visual design concepts: The designer should create visually appealing design concepts that align with the project goals and user preferences.
8. Collaborate with the project manager on project goals and objectives: Regular communication with the project manager ensures the designer's work aligns with the project's overall vision.

#### Programmer Responsibilities
9. Evaluate technology options and make recommendations: The programmer needs to research and recommend the most suitable technologies for the project.
10. Set up a version control system: Establishing a version control system enables efficient collaboration among team members and helps track changes made to the project.
11. Develop coding standards and guidelines: Following coding standards ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.
12. Implement basic system architecture: The programmer should design a robust and scalable system architecture that can serve as a foundation for future development.

#### QA Engineer Responsibilities
13. Create a test plan: The QA engineer must document test cases and strategies to ensure comprehensive testing of the software.
14. Conduct initial testing of software components: Performing rigorous testing on software components helps identify any defects or areas for improvement.
15. Identify and report defects: The QA engineer should thoroughly document and communicate any issues or bugs discovered during testing.
16. Collaborate with the project manager on project scope and requirements: Regular collaboration ensures that the project's scope and requirements are understood and met.

By meeting these 16 development criteria, a team can successfully pass Milestone 1: Project Charter. Each role has its unique responsibilities, and effective collaboration and communication among team members are vital for achieving the desired outcomes of the milestone.

Remember, Milestone 1 lays the groundwork for the entire project, setting the stage for success as the team progresses further.
