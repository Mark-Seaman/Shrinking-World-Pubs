## Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

In this milestone, we must complete the product implementation for all of the features.  There will
be an official checklist of features in the product backlog that will define the work to be done.
A burn-down graph will track the remaining features and open defects in the product.  We will
measure velocity to determine when the product will be done.

We will test the web-based software app and ensure that it meets the requirements
specified in the requirements document. We will use automated testing tools and manual testing to
verify that the app works as expected. We will identify and fix any defects or issues that arise
during testing.  50% of all code written must be test code. Code coverage should be over 95%
