## Plan for the QA Engineer in Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

There are several goals that related to Quality Assurance in Milestone 4. 
The most important tasks are to validate the features, build a robust test strategy, measure 
test coverage and track open issues (both features and defects).

Remember to continuously communicate and collaborate with the development
team to ensure that any defects are promptly addressed and fixes are thoroughly tested.


### Review and validate the product backlog

As a QA engineer, your first goal is to thoroughly review and validate the product backlog. Ensure
that all the features and requirements specified in the requirements document are covered in the
product backlog. This can be measured by comparing the items in the product backlog with the
requirements document and confirming their alignment. The deliverable for this goal is a validated
product backlog that accurately reflects all the necessary features and requirements.

Work with the project manager to ensure that the burn-down graph and velocity are accurate and
updated. Work together on any updates that are required to meet the scheduled release.

### Develop a comprehensive testing strategy

Your next goal is to develop a comprehensive testing strategy for the software app. Define which
areas of the app need to be automated and which ones should be manually tested. Create a test plan
that outlines the different types of tests that will be executed, such as functional testing,
regression testing, and performance testing. Additionally, identify the resources needed for
testing and define the testing environment. The deliverable for this goal is a well-defined testing
strategy document.

### Implement automated tests with high coverage

Automated testing is crucial to catch potential defects early on. As a QA engineer, your goal is to
implement automated tests that cover at least 50% of the total code written. Use automated testing
tools, such as unit testing frameworks, to write robust test cases that cover all possible
scenarios and edge cases. Additionally, ensure that the test coverage is above 95% by using tools
for code coverage measurement. The deliverable for this goal is a suite of automated tests with
high coverage.

### Execute thorough manual tests and document defects

Manual testing is necessary to validate the app's usability, user interface, and user experience.
Your goal as a QA engineer is to create test cases that cover all the requirements specified in the
requirements document and execute them manually. Pay attention to the app's responsiveness, ease of
use, and consistency of design. Document any defects or issues discovered during manual testing.
The deliverable for this goal is a comprehensive defect log with detailed descriptions of each
issue.
