Replace this syntax

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, total_price):
        self.total_price = total_price

order = Order(100)
discounted_price = order.calculate_discounted_price()
```

With this syntax

    class Order:
        def __init__(self, total_price):
            self.total_price = total_price

    order = Order(100)
    discounted_price = order.calculate_discounted_price()
