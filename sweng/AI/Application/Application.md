# Application Project

Throughout this course you will build a medium sized application with the following guidelines

* Patterned after a popular web-based application
* Build software with a team of four people
* Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
* Each milestone every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates 

## Selecting Your Project

Here are eight project ideas patterned after popular web-based apps:

* Project 1: A social media platform patterned after Instagram, called "InstaSnap". InstaSnap allows
  users to post photos and videos, follow other users, and view their content in a chronological
  feed. Users can also like, comment, and share content, and search for content based on hashtags.

* Project 2: An e-commerce platform patterned after Amazon, called "ShopZone". ShopZone allows users
  to browse and purchase products from various sellers, add items to their cart, and complete the
  checkout process. Users can also leave reviews and ratings for products, and search for products
  based on keywords.

* Project 3: A communication platform patterned after Slack, called "TeamTalk". TeamTalk allows
  users to send messages and files to each other in channels or direct messages. Users can also
  create and join teams, and customize notifications and settings.

* Project 4: A video sharing platform patterned after YouTube, called "ViewTube". ViewTube allows
  users to upload and watch videos, subscribe to channels, and view their content in a
  chronological feed. Users can also like, comment, and share videos, and search for videos based
  on keywords.

* Project 5: A project management platform patterned after Trello, called "TaskBoard". TaskBoard
  allows users to create and manage tasks on boards, add labels and deadlines, and assign tasks to
  team members. Users can also customize notifications and settings, and view their tasks in a
  calendar view.

* Project 6: A travel booking platform patterned after Airbnb, called "StayBook". StayBook allows
  users to search and book accommodations, including apartments, houses, and hotels, in various
  locations. Users can also leave reviews and ratings for accommodations, and view photos and
  amenities.

* Project 7: A music streaming platform patterned after Spotify, called "StreamTunes". StreamTunes
  allows users to search and stream music, create and share playlists, and view their listening
  history. Users can also like and follow artists, and customize their preferences.

* Project 8: A professional networking platform patterned after LinkedIn, called "ConnectPro".
  ConnectPro allows users to create and manage a professional profile, search and apply for jobs,
  and network with other professionals. Users can also follow companies and industry leaders, and
  view job recommendations based on their profile.

By building these projects, teams can gain experience in software engineering by working on a
variety of web-based applications, each with their own unique features and functionality.
