Learn software engineer by doing software engineering.  
Build a medium sized app with a team of four people.  
Pattern your work after a popular web application.

Throughout this course you will build a medium sized application with the following guidelines

* Patterned after a popular web-based application
* Build software with a team of four people
* Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
* For each milestone every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates 
* Each team member will deliver the task assigned for that milestone based on the role

Teaching engineering requires students to get hands-on experience
