# Project Guidelines

1. **Application Design**: Your application should be patterned after a popular web-based application. This means that you should analyze existing web applications and identify the features and design patterns that make them successful. Use this analysis as a guide when designing your own application.

2. **Team Composition**: The project will be carried out in teams of four people. Each team member will have a specific role assigned to them for each milestone. These roles include requirements, design, code, and test. The roles will rotate with each milestone, ensuring that every team member gets hands-on experience in each aspect of the software development process.

3. **Milestone Deliverables**: There will be seven milestones throughout the course, with one milestone every two weeks. Each milestone will have specific deliverables that need to be completed by each team member based on their assigned role. It is important that you adhere to the fixed schedule and submit your work on time.

4. **Responsibilities Rotation**: As mentioned earlier, the responsibilities will rotate with each milestone. This means that each team member will have the opportunity to take on different roles throughout the project. This rotation is designed to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development process and develop a well-rounded skill set.


## Software Project Milestones

We will be working with seven milestones, each of which are a step toward the completed application.

* **Milestone 1**: Requirements Gathering and Analysis
* **Milestone 2**: Software Design and Architecture
* **Milestone 3**: Implementation and Coding
* **Milestone 4**: Testing and Quality Assurance
* **Milestone 5**: Deployment and Release Management
* **Milestone 6**: User Feedback and Enhancement
* **Milestone 7**: Project Closeout


## Development Roles

Throughout this project students will perform a unique role: requirements, design, code, test.  
Each milestone every member will be assigned a set of tasks to complete. The roles will rotate
with each milestone exposing every student to every mindset that required of engineers.

Specific outcomes will be delivered by each student.  Assignments will be at the beginning of each
milestone so that everyone can work toward the expected result. Each milestone will end by
assessing the work for every team member.


## Assignment Details

For this project, your team will be building a medium-sized application with the goal of learning software engineering and gaining hands-on experience. The application should be patterned after a popular web-based application, which will serve as a guide for your design and implementation.

There will be specific assignments for each milestone and each development role:

Please note that these assignments will rotate with each milestone, meaning that each team member will have the opportunity to take on different roles throughout the project.


## Conclusion

I hope you are excited about this Software Application Team Project! This project will give you the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in software engineering and work on a medium-sized application with a team of four people. Remember to adhere to the project guidelines and deliver your work on schedule. Good luck and enjoy the learning journey!
