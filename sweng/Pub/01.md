# Chapter 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

## Concepts

### Overview of Software Engineering

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, and
maintenance of software. It is a discipline that combines knowledge from computer science,
mathematics, and engineering to produce high-quality software products.  Software Engineers need to
possess a broad set of skills, including technical expertise, analytical and problem-solving
skills, communication and collaboration skills, and project management skills. 

The field of software engineering has evolved significantly over the years, driven by the demand for
better software products and the need to manage the complexity of software systems. Software
engineering involves various processes, tools, and techniques that enable software developers to
create software that meets user requirements, is reliable, scalable, and maintainable. These
processes include requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.


Software Engineering encompasses a wide range of activities, including project planning, risk
management, quality assurance, configuration management, and documentation. Software engineering is
essential for the development of reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems that meet the
needs of users and organizations. 


### Software Development Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that describes the phases and activities
involved in software development. The SDLC typically consists of six phases:

**Requirements**: This phase involves gathering and analyzing the
requirements of the software system to be developed. Requirements can be functional (what the
software system should do) or non-functional (how the software system should perform).

**Design**: In this phase, the software system's architecture and design are developed based on the
requirements. Design involves defining the software components, their interactions, and the
data structures and algorithms used.

**Code**: In this phase, the software system is developed using programming languages,
software libraries, and frameworks. The implementation phase involves coding, debugging, and
testing the software system.

**Test**: In this phase, the software system is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements
and performs as expected. Testing can be done at different levels, including unit testing,
integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

**Deployment**: In this phase, the software system is released and installed on the target platform.
Deployment involves configuring the software system, installing it on the target machines, and
providing user training and support.

**Maintenance**: In this phase, the software system is maintained and evolved over time. Maintenance
can involve fixing bugs, adding new features, improving performance, and adapting the software
system to new requirements and technologies.


### Software Requirements

Software Requirements are the foundation of software development. Requirements define what the
software system should do and how it should behave. Requirements can be classified into different
types, including functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and domain requirements.

Functional requirements describe the software system's behavior and functionality, such as user
interfaces, data processing, and business rules. Non-functional requirements describe the software
system's quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, usability, and security. Domain
requirements describe the specific characteristics of the application domain, such as regulations,
standards, and best practices.

Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and
managing requirements. Requirements engineering involves collaboration between stakeholders, such
as users, customers, developers, and testers. Conclusion

Requirements engineering is an essential aspect of software engineering because it lays the
foundation for the entire software development process. Poorly defined requirements can lead to
software products that do not meet user needs, are unreliable, and difficult to maintain.
Therefore, requirements engineering must be done carefully, and software requirements must be
documented, validated, and verified throughout the software development life cycle. 


### Software Process Models

A software process model is a framework that describes the activities involved in software
development and the order in which they occur. Process models provide a structured approach to
software development, enabling software developers to plan and manage the software development
process effectively. There are various software process models, including the waterfall model,
iterative model, and agile model.

The waterfall model is a sequential software development process that follows a linear and rigid
approach. The iterative model is a software development process that involves repeating a series of
steps until a satisfactory software product is developed. The agile model is a software development
process that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid prototyping.

In conclusion, this chapter provided an overview of software engineering, the software development
life cycle, software requirements, and software process models. The next chapter will focus on
software design, which involves creating software architectures, modules, and components that meet
user needs and organizational goals.

## Application Project

Throughout this course you will build a medium sized application with the following guidelines

* Patterned after a popular web-based application
* Build software with a team of four people
* Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
* Each milestone every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates 


### Possible Apps to Choose

Sure, here are eight project ideas patterned after popular web-based apps:

* Project 1: A social media platform patterned after Instagram, called "InstaSnap". InstaSnap allows
  users to post photos and videos, follow other users, and view their content in a chronological
  feed. Users can also like, comment, and share content, and search for content based on hashtags.

* Project 2: An e-commerce platform patterned after Amazon, called "ShopZone". ShopZone allows users
  to browse and purchase products from various sellers, add items to their cart, and complete the
  checkout process. Users can also leave reviews and ratings for products, and search for products
  based on keywords.

* Project 3: A communication platform patterned after Slack, called "TeamTalk". TeamTalk allows
  users to send messages and files to each other in channels or direct messages. Users can also
  create and join teams, and customize notifications and settings.

* Project 4: A video sharing platform patterned after YouTube, called "ViewTube". ViewTube allows
  users to upload and watch videos, subscribe to channels, and view their content in a
  chronological feed. Users can also like, comment, and share videos, and search for videos based
  on keywords.

* Project 5: A project management platform patterned after Trello, called "TaskBoard". TaskBoard
  allows users to create and manage tasks on boards, add labels and deadlines, and assign tasks to
  team members. Users can also customize notifications and settings, and view their tasks in a
  calendar view.

* Project 6: A travel booking platform patterned after Airbnb, called "StayBook". StayBook allows
  users to search and book accommodations, including apartments, houses, and hotels, in various
