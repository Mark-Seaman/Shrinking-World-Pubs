# Milestone 4: Functionality Complete

The primary goal of Milestone 4 is to finish implmenting the functionality of the product.
This also requires the full test system to be deployed and working properly.  Look at this
list of general requirements and then read the detailed task assignments for each role.

### Step 1: Review the product backlog

Before starting the testing phase, it is important to review the product backlog. This will enable a clear understanding of all the features that need to be implemented and tested. Ensure that all the requirements specified in the requirements document are covered in the product backlog.

### Step 2: Define the testing strategy

It is crucial to define a testing strategy before starting the actual testing process. Determine which areas of the software app need to be automated and which ones require manual testing. Create a test plan that outlines the different types of tests that will be executed, such as functional testing, regression testing, and performance testing. Also, define the testing environment and identify the resources needed for testing.

### Step 3: Implement automated tests

Automated testing is essential to ensure that the app functions correctly and to catch any potential defects early on. Use automated testing tools, such as unit testing frameworks, to write test code that covers at least 50% of the total code written. Consider using tools for code coverage measurement to ensure that the test coverage is above 95%. Focus on writing robust test cases that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.

### Step 4: Execute manual tests

Manual testing is necessary to validate the app's usability, user interface, and user experience. Create test cases that cover all the requirements specified in the requirements document and execute them manually. Pay attention to the app's responsiveness, ease of use, and consistency of design. Document any issues or defects discovered during manual testing.

### Step 5: Identify and fix defects

During the testing phase, defects and issues will inevitably surface. It is important to carefully track and prioritize these defects to ensure the most critical ones are fixed first. Use a defect tracking system to log and monitor the defects. Assign resources to resolve the defects promptly and ensure that fixes are thoroughly tested before being deployed.

### Step 6: Monitor burn-down graph and velocity

Continuously monitor the burn-down graph, which tracks the progress of completing the features and resolving defects. The burn-down graph should decrease steadily towards zero as more features are implemented and defects are fixed. Measure velocity to determine the speed at which features are being implemented and adjusted. Adjust the plan and resource allocation as necessary based on the progress shown by the burn-down graph and velocity.

### Step 7: Re-test and re-validate

Once defects are fixed, re-test the affected areas of the app to ensure that the fixes have resolved the issues effectively. Perform regression testing to ensure that existing functionality has not been impacted by the fixes. Validate that the app meets all the requirements specified in the requirements document and that it functions correctly and seamlessly.

Following these steps will ensure a robust and efficient testing and quality assurance process for Milestone 4. Remember to document all the testing activities, defects, and fixes for future reference.
