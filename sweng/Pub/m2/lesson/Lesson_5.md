# Lesson 5 - Milestone 2 - Requirements

The goal of milestone 2 is to proove the technical feasibility.

## Requirements Role

**Feature list (20 to do, 20 to not do)**

Create a list of features that will be delivered in Phase 1 of the project.  These define the minimum viable product.  This should contain at least 20 specific features.

This list of features serves as the initial product backlog.  It must be prioritized in chronological order.  The engineering team will deliver these features in the order they are listed.

Create a second list of features that will be delivered after Phase 1.   This serves to identify the functionality that will not get attention until Phase 1 is complete.   Additional product releases may be made that will build on this feature set.  The Phase 2 list should contain about 20 items that are not being worked on presently.
