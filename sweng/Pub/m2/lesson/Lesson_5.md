# Lesson 5 - Milestone 2 - Requirements

The goal of milestone 2 is to prove the technical feasibility.

## Requirements Role

**Feature list (20 to do, 20 to not do)**

Create a list of features that will be delivered in Phase 1 of the project.  These define the minimum viable product.  This should contain at least 20 specific features.

This list of features serves as the initial product backlog.  It must be prioritized in chronological order.  The engineering team will deliver these features in the order they are listed.

Create a second list of features that will be delivered after Phase 1.   This serves to identify the functionality that will not get attention until Phase 1 is complete.   Additional product releases may be made that will build on this feature set.  The Phase 2 list should contain about 20 items that are not being worked on presently.

## Define The Value Proposition

**Value Statement (One Sentence):** Start every project by describing in one sentence the value 
of the product.  Every other goal on the project must contribute to this value proposition.  This
is better if it is shorter and more pointed.

**Product Usage (One Paragraph):** Expand to one paragraph to describe the product usage.  Include the
customers and users.  Decribe how this product meets market need. Show how the technology used will
offer key benefits.

**Product Overview (One Page):** Write one page to explain how the product works.  Compare it to other
solutions available.  Write a sales pitch.


## Minimum Viable Product
Now build a list of 40 specific user stories.
Split this list in two to show the stories needed for the MVP and those for future enhancements.
The MVP features are now sorted by priority.
This is the Product Backlog.  Each sprint will draw from the Product Backlog.
The dev team will work on the features in order of priority.

## Future Enhancements
The second list of 20 user stories defines the content for the likely follow on product.  These future
enhancement are specifically identified as not part of the MVP.  This allows the dev team to focus on 
creating the necessary features for the first release.

## Example Project

**Value Statement:** The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly task management application that helps individuals and teams organize their work efficiently.

**Product Usage (One Paragraph):** The task management application will provide users with a platform to create, prioritize, and track tasks and projects. Users can easily collaborate with team members, set deadlines, categorize tasks, and view progress reports. The application aims to streamline work processes and enhance productivity for both individual and group tasks.

**Product Overview (One Page):** The task management application is designed to be a web-based platform accessible on various devices. It consists of a user-friendly dashboard where users can create, view, and manage tasks. Users can organize tasks into different projects, assign them to team members, set due dates, and add descriptions or attachments. A notification system keeps users informed about task updates and deadlines. The application will include reporting and analytics features to help users track their productivity and make data-driven decisions. It will also integrate with popular productivity tools and calendars for seamless task management.

18. As a user, I want to view a progress dashboard for each project.
19. As a user, I want to track the time spent on tasks.
20. As a user, I want to set recurring tasks.

**User Stories For Future Enhancements:**

39. As a user, I want to receive automated task suggestions based on my previous activities.
40. As a user, I want to set task privacy settings for sensitive information.

**Product Backlog:** The product backlog consists of all the user stories sorted by priority, with the most critical features for the MVP at the top.

**Development Process:** The development team will work on the features in the order specified in the product backlog. Each sprint will draw user stories from the backlog, focusing on implementing and testing the highest-priority features first, ensuring that the most valuable aspects of the application are delivered early in the development process.
Start every project by describing in one sentence the value of the product.
