# Lesson 6 - Milestone 2 - Test

The goal of milestone 2 is to proove the technical feasibility.

## Test Role

**Automated deployment from source code**

Devops is the combination of development and operations.   This is how the dev team gets the code onto the web application hosting environment.  

Set up some form of continuous integration and continuous deployment:
- One command to perform the deployment from source code
- A process to monitor the build and escalate the failures (may be manual or automated)
- An automatic test that loads the web page after the server has updated
