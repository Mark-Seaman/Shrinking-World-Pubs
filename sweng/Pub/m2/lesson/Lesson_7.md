# Lesson 6 - Milestone 2 - Code

The goal of milestone 2 is to proove the technical feasibility.

## Code Role

**Prototype of one key feature**

Implement and deploy a simple prototype that shows the most important feature of the code. This acts as proof that the project is technically feasible.

Example:

- **Linked In** (create friend graph)
- **Instagram** (upload photos to server)
- **Amazon** - create a shopping cart (add, list, edit, delete)
- **Trello** - create a dependency graph of tasks to do
