# Lesson 6 - Milestone 2 - Code

The goal of milestone 2 is to prove the technical feasibility.


## Code Role

**Prototype of one key feature**

Implement and deploy a simple prototype that shows the most important feature of the code. This acts as proof that the project is technically feasible.

Example:

- **Linked In** (create friend graph)
- **Instagram** (upload photos to server)
- **Amazon** - create a shopping cart (add, list, edit, delete)
- **Trello** - create a dependency graph of tasks to do


## Product Code

Your code will need to involve 1-3 data types.  Create the simplest design that shows the
key feature.

Implement the needed data functions and views:

* CREATE - Create View
* READ - List View, Details View (many & one)
* UPDATE - Update View
* DELETE - Delete View


## Test Code

Implement the needed tests for data:

* CREATE - Create Record
* READ - List Records, Record Details (many & one)
* UPDATE - Update Record
* DELETE - Delete Record

Implement the needed tests for views:

* CREATE - Create View
* READ - List View, Details View (many & one)
* UPDATE - Update View
* DELETE - Delete View
