# Milestone 5 - Code Complete

Throughout the project development cycle, each milestone plays a vital role in ensuring successful
and efficient completion. Milestone 5 is no exception, as it presents several crucial deliverables
that are essential for project progress. 

The most important deliverables for Milestone 5 encompass various aspects that are
crucial for project progress. Each member of the team has
essential responsibilities that contribute to the overall success of the project. From monitoring
progress and conducting meetings to refining designs, reviewing code, and conducting thorough
testing, these deliverables ensure the project remains on track, meets stakeholder expectations,
and delivers a high-quality final product.

First and foremost, the Project Manager's responsibilities are of utmost importance. Monitoring the
project progress and identifying areas for improvement allows them to ensure the project stays on
track and address any obstacles that may arise. Regular team meetings serve as a platform for
discussing the project's status, promoting collaboration, and fostering open communication among
team members. Moreover, the Project Manager plays a critical role in communicating project updates
to stakeholders, ensuring they are kept informed of the progress and any changes that may impact
the project's outcome. Providing support and guidance to team members is also crucial, as it
enables the team to stay motivated and work together towards the project's success. Additionally,
conducting a customer acceptance meeting allows the Project Manager to gather feedback and ensure
customer satisfaction.

The role of the Designer is equally important. They not only provide assistance and support to other
team members but also collaborate with the Project Manager on project evaluation. Seeking feedback
from team members on design improvements allows the Designer to continuously refine and enhance the
project's design. Providing design updates and progress reports ensures transparency and keeps
everyone informed. The Designer's task of refactoring report, before and after design, showcases
the improvements made and their impact on the project's overall quality. Lastly, creating a design
pattern catalog establishes a valuable resource for future projects and standardizes design
practices.

The Programmer's responsibilities are crucial in ensuring the project's successful development.
Reviewing code and providing feedback to team members promotes code quality and collaboration.
Collaborating with the Project Manager on project evaluation ensures alignment between development
efforts and project goals. Seeking feedback from team members on code improvements allows the
Programmer to continuously enhance their code. Providing progress updates on code development keeps
everyone informed of the development process. Recording a Test-Driven Development (TDD) log plays a
critical role in documenting iterations, their outcomes, and the time spent, serving as a reference
for future improvements and analysis.

The QA Engineer's role is vital in ensuring the project's quality. Conducting acceptance testing and
providing feedback to team members helps identify and resolve any issues in the project
deliverables. Collaborating with the Project Manager on project evaluation ensures that testing
efforts align with project goals. Seeking feedback from team members on testing improvements
promotes continuous improvement in the testing process. Providing regular updates on testing
progress keeps everyone informed about the project's quality status. Achieving 90% test coverage
and 50% test code highlights the thoroughness of the testing efforts conducted. Lastly, performing
usability testing for another team showcases the QA Engineer's expertise and strengthens the
testing capabilities within the organization.
