# Lesson 18 - Milestone 5 - Design


## Design support to team members

In order to ensure that team members have the resources and guidance they need to complete their
tasks effectively, it is important to provide assistance and support. This can involve answering
questions, offering clarification, and providing guidance on best practices. By offering help, the
designer can help the team members overcome any obstacles they may encounter and ultimately
contribute to the successful completion of the project.

To collaborate with the project manager on project evaluation, the designer works closely with them
to assess the progress and effectiveness of the project. This includes evaluating the overall
performance of the team, identifying areas for improvement, and determining if the project is on
track to meet its goals. By collaborating with the project manager, the designer can ensure that
any necessary adjustments or improvements are made to optimize the project's success.

Seeking feedback from team members on design improvements is an important step in the development
process. By gathering input from different perspectives, the designer can identify potential issues
or areas for improvement that may not be obvious to them. This feedback helps refine and enhance
the design, ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of customers. Actively seeking feedback
demonstrates the designer's commitment to creating the best possible product.


## Design improvements

Keeping stakeholders informed about the project's status is essential, and providing design updates
and progress reports is one way to do this. These updates may include details on design revisions,
milestones achieved, and any challenges or obstacles encountered. By regularly communicating
progress, the designer maintains transparency and ensures that everyone involved in the project has
a clear understanding of its current state. This enables stakeholders to provide valuable input and
make informed decisions.


Refactoring is the process of making changes to the design to improve its structure and readability.
Selecting one design area and refactoring it can simplify the design and make it more efficient. A
refactoring report is a comprehensive document that highlights the changes made to the design
throughout the development process. It compares the design before and after the refactoring
process, explaining the reasons for the changes and the impact they had on the overall product.
This report serves as a reference for future iterations or updates.


## Design pattern catalog

Building a design pattern catalog can greatly benefit software development teams. It provides a
comprehensive overview of different design patterns that can be used in a project, ensuring
consistency and best practices. Let's go through the steps of creating a design pattern catalog
together.

First, understand the project requirements. Take the time to thoroughly grasp the project goals and
constraints. This will help you select the most appropriate design patterns for the project.

Examine your code to look for design patterns.  Categorize the design patterns according to their
purpose and usage. Group them as creational, structural, or behavioral patterns. This will make it
easier to find the right pattern for a particular scenario.

Show concrete examples from your code. Show how they can be implemented in real-world scenarios that
are relevant to the project. By doing so, you'll help the team understand how to apply the patterns
effectively.

Explain the benefits of using each design pattern. Highlight how the patterns can improve code
quality, maintainability, flexibility, and reusability. This will demonstrate the value of design
patterns to the team.

Include design guidelines or best practices for each pattern. These guidelines will outline the
recommended ways to use the pattern and any potential pitfalls to avoid. By following these
guidelines, the team can ensure effective implementation.

Keep the design pattern catalog updated. Design patterns evolve, and new patterns may emerge.
Regularly review and revise the catalog to ensure its relevance and value.

Building a design pattern catalog should be a collaborative effort. Involve experienced software
developers, architects, and designers in the process. Make the catalog easily accessible to the
team in a digital format like a wiki or shared document.

Creating and maintaining a design pattern catalog will enable the team to consistently apply
efficient design practices, resulting in high-quality software products.


## Help with implementation

Once the design is finalized, it is time to start implementing the code and testing it. The designer
can provide support to the team during this phase to help finish the code and ensure it is
functioning correctly. This can involve offering guidance on best practices, troubleshooting any
issues that arise, and assisting with testing and debugging. By providing help with implementation,
the designer can contribute to the successful completion of the project.
