# Milestone 1: Project Charter

When working on software development projects, collaboration among team members is crucial for success. Each team member plays a unique role and has specific responsibilities that contribute to the overall goal of the project. In this article, we will explore the goals of the milestone and how the different roles of project manager, designer, programmer, and QA engineer work together.

The goal of Milestone 1 is to establish the foundation for the project. 

Collaboration among team members is key to successful software development. Each role in the project, whether it be the project manager, designer, programmer, or QA engineer, contributes to the overall goals and objectives. By working together and fulfilling their respective responsibilities, the team can create high-quality software that meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.


## General Responsibilities

The responsibilities for each role in the milestone can be categorized into four areas: requirements, design, code, and test.

### Requirements

The project manager takes the lead in defining the project goals and objectives, as well as the scope and deliverables. They also identify the stakeholders and develop a timeline and budget. This information sets the direction for the project and provides a clear roadmap for the team to follow.

### Design

The designer plays a crucial role in this milestone by conducting user research and analysis. They gather insights into the target audience and identify their needs and preferences. Using this information, they create wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user experience. Collaborating closely with the project manager, the designer ensures that the project goals align with the user needs and expectations.

### Code

The programmer brings technical expertise to the project. They evaluate technology options and make recommendations based on the project requirements. They also set up a version control system, which allows the team to track and manage changes to the codebase effectively. Additionally, the programmer develops coding standards and guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability of the code. Their work in implementing the basic system architecture sets a solid foundation for the development process.

### Test

The QA engineer's role is critical in ensuring the quality of the software. They create a test plan, which outlines the testing approach and objectives. By conducting initial testing of the software components, they identify and report defects. Collaboration with the project manager is essential to ensure that the project scope and requirements are being met. The QA engineer serves as the gatekeeper for quality, ensuring that the software meets the desired standards.
