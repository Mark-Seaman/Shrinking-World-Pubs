# Software Development Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that describes the phases and activities
involved in software development. The SDLC typically consists of six phases:

**Requirements**: This phase involves gathering and analyzing the
requirements of the software system to be developed. Requirements can be functional (what the
software system should do) or non-functional (how the software system should perform).

**Design**: In this phase, the software system's architecture and design are developed based on the
requirements. Design involves defining the software components, their interactions, and the
data structures and algorithms used.

**Code**: In this phase, the software system is developed using programming languages,
software libraries, and frameworks. The implementation phase involves coding, debugging, and
testing the software system.

**Test**: In this phase, the software system is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements
and performs as expected. Testing can be done at different levels, including unit testing,
integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

**Deployment**: In this phase, the software system is released and installed on the target platform.
Deployment involves configuring the software system, installing it on the target machines, and
providing user training and support.

**Maintenance**: In this phase, the software system is maintained and evolved over time. Maintenance
can involve fixing bugs, adding new features, improving performance, and adapting the software
system to new requirements and technologies.


## Software Process Models

A software process model is a framework that describes the activities involved in software
development and the order in which they occur. Process models provide a structured approach to
software development, enabling software developers to plan and manage the software development
process effectively. There are various software process models, including the waterfall model,
iterative model, and agile model.

The waterfall model is a sequential software development process that follows a linear and rigid
approach. The iterative model is a software development process that involves repeating a series of
steps until a satisfactory software product is developed. The agile model is a software development
process that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid prototyping.


## Iterative Development

The iterative development lifecycle is a key concept in software engineering that allows teams to build and improve software in a systematic and efficient way. It's like a recipe for success in the world of coding.

Imagine you're tasked with building a sophisticated app that tracks fitness and nutrition. You might start with a basic version that can record daily steps and calories consumed. This first version is your starting point, your foundation.

You don't stop there, though. The iterative development lifecycle encourages you to continuously improve your software by going through a series of steps, or iterations. Each iteration is like adding another layer of frosting to a cake – it makes the end result even more delicious.

In the next iteration, you might add features like the ability to set goals, track heart rate, or even offer personalized workout plans. And with each iteration, you gather feedback from users, allowing you to refine the software based on real-world usage.

Now, here's the thing – the iterative development lifecycle is all about breaking the development process into chunks, or iterations, that are manageable and achievable. Rather than trying to build the entire app in one go, you focus on delivering smaller, valuable increments of functionality with each iteration.

By doing this, you're able to reduce risks, identify and solve issues early on, and adapt to changes in requirements or user needs. It's like building a house one brick at a time – you can fix any mistakes as you go along, rather than waiting until the end to realize you built a crooked wall.

Think of it this way: the iterative development lifecycle is like a continuous improvement cycle. With each iteration, you build, test, and refine your software. You loop back to the beginning and repeat the process again and again, each time making it even better.


## Software Development Milestones

The development proceed through a series of milestones.  At each checkpoint a number of criteria
must be met in order for development to continue.


### Milestone 1: Requirements Gathering and Analysis

In this milestone, we will work with stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements for the
web-based software app. We will create a detailed requirements document that outlines the scope,
features, and functionality of the app.


### Milestone 2: Software Design and Architecture

In this milestone, we will design the architecture and user interface of the web-based software app.
We will create a detailed software design document that outlines the high-level architecture of the
app, the user interface design, and the technology stack that will be used.


### Milestone 3: Prototype Development

In this milestone, we will develop a functional prototype of the web-based software app. We will use
an agile development approach and build the minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core
features and functionality.


### Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

In this milestone, we will test the web-based software app and ensure that it meets the requirements
specified in the requirements document. We will use automated testing tools and manual testing to
verify that the app works as expected. We will identify and fix any defects or issues that arise
during testing.


### Milestone 5: Integration and Deployment

In this milestone, we will integrate the web-based software app with any third-party services or
APIs and deploy it to a production environment. We will use continuous integration and deployment
tools to automate the deployment process and ensure that the app is available to users.


### Milestone 6: User Feedback and Enhancement

In this milestone, we will gather feedback from users and identify areas for improvement. We will
use this feedback to enhance the web-based software app and release updates and improvements as
needed. We will also monitor the performance and usage of the app to identify any issues or areas
for improvement.


### Milestone 7: Project Release

In this milestone, we will conduct a project review and analyze the project performance. We will
document any lessons learned and prepare a final report. We will celebrate our successes and
identify areas for improvement for future projects.
