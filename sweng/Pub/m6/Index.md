# [Milestone 6 - Software Release](m6-Index.md)

The release of a software product is a major milestone in any project. It signifies the completion of development and marks the transition to the next phase of the product's lifecycle. In order to ensure a successful release, each member of the team has specific responsibilities to fulfill. Let's take a closer look at what each role entails in this important milestone.

## Project Manager

As the project manager, your primary responsibility is to gain approval for the product release from the customer. This requires close coordination with the development team to address any outstanding issues or challenges. By effectively communicating issue resolutions to stakeholders, you can ensure that everyone is on the same page and has a clear understanding of the product's readiness for release. Additionally, updating operations plans based on the project's status is essential for a seamless transition to the next phase.

## Designer

The designer plays a crucial role in the software development process. During the release milestone, their focus is on reviewing design-related issues and challenges. By collaborating closely with the project manager, the designer can contribute to the resolution of these issues. Seeking feedback from team members on design improvements allows for continuous iteration and enhancement. Providing regular design updates and progress reports helps keep everyone informed and ensures that the product meets the desired visual standards.

## Programmer

The programmer is responsible for reviewing code-related issues and challenges during the release milestone. Similar to the designer, their collaboration with the project manager is key in resolving any outstanding issues. Seeking feedback from team members on code improvements allows for the incorporation of different perspectives and expertise. Providing progress updates on code development helps set expectations and showcases the team's accomplishments.

## QA Engineer

The role of the QA engineer is crucial in ensuring the quality and functionality of the software product. During the release milestone, their focus is on reviewing testing-related issues and challenges. Collaborating closely with the project manager, the QA engineer can contribute to the resolution of these issues. Seeking feedback from team members on testing improvements helps enhance the testing process and ensures thorough coverage. Providing regular updates on testing progress enables the team to stay informed and addresses any potential issues before the release.

In conclusion, the release of a software product is a significant milestone that requires the coordination and collaboration of all team members. Each role has specific responsibilities, from gaining approval from the customer to resolving design, code, and testing issues. By working together and providing regular updates and progress reports, the team can ensure a successful software product release.
