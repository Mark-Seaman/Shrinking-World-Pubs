# Lesson 22 - Milestone 6 - Design

## Designer Role

Designers play a crucial role in any project, as they are responsible for creating visually
appealing and user-friendly designs. However, they often face a number of challenges and issues
that need to be addressed in order to ensure a smooth design process and successful outcomes. 

Designers ensure success by addressing all of the design-related issues and challenges. By
collaborating with the project manager, seeking feedback from team members, and providing regular
updates, designers can ensure that the final design meets project objectives and user needs.


### Review design issues

One of the key responsibilities of a designer is to review design-related issues and challenges.
This includes identifying any issues that may arise during the design process, such as technical
limitations or conflicting design requirements. By reviewing and addressing these issues, designers
can ensure that the final design meets the project objectives and aligns with user needs.


### Collaborate with project manager on issue resolution

Collaboration is also essential for designers, particularly with the project manager. By working
closely with the project manager, designers can effectively address any design-related challenges
and come up with viable solutions. This collaboration allows for a more streamlined and efficient
design process, ultimately leading to better final designs.


### Seek feedback from team members on design improvements

Seeking feedback from team members is another important aspect of a designer's role. By actively
seeking input from other team members, designers can gather different perspectives and insights
that can help identify opportunities for improvement. This feedback can be invaluable in refining
and enhancing the design, ensuring that it meets both user expectations and project requirements.


### Provide design updates and progress reports

Furthermore, providing design updates and progress reports is crucial for maintaining effective
communication within the team. By regularly updating the team on design progress, designers can
keep everyone informed of the current status and any potential issues. This open communication
ensures that any design-related challenges are addressed in a timely manner, preventing any delays
or setbacks in the project.
