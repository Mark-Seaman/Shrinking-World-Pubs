# Learn By Doing

It impossible to learn about software engineering by reading a book or listening to lectures.

Software Engineering requires hands-on experience.

Experience comes from doing projects.

Experience let you see many different situations.

With practice productivity grows, quickly at first and more slowly eventually.

This is because the learning required decreases with experience.

This is mathematically known as an exponential decay.

This class focus on doing engineering in a realistic environment.

There will be no lectures or tests.

Every person will be a part of a team to build a commercial software app.

Each individual will have specific assignments to teach engineering practices.
