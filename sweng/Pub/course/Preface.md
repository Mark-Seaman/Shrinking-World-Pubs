# Teaching Software Engineering Skills

As a professional software engineer I have worked with several hundred new engineers.   It has been fascinating to watch people learn the skills that are required to succeed in the complex world of software development.

People are largely unprepared for work in the real world after graduating from college.  I vowed that I would address these issues if I ever got a chance to teach at a university.  Seven years ago this became a reality for me as I was invited to teach software engineering at the University of Northern Colorado.

I am now in my third time teaching this course and with each opportunity the technique and methods used have been improved.  I now have a finely tuned approach that is calibrated to the actual learning experience of the students.  This document is an outline of the practices that are used in the class.

I am sharing this  content to inspire others to follow the principles outlined here and the practices that make sense in their context.  These teaching methods are built to address what I see as key deficiencies in the typical college class for technology.

- Lack of actual problem solving and critical thinking
- Learning how to answer factual and conceptual questions rather than building something.
- Avoiding the need to learn teamwork based on individual responsibility
- Accountability for building working software using a good process
- Learning to work in milestones so that progress can be explicitly measured
- Presentation of a progress report with a five-minute video to the client at each milestone
- Lack of experience with version control
- Not knowing how to make adjustments to the project scope when the project is running behind
- Lack of practice at applying the skills of agile software development

Each of these issues greatly limit junior engineers and should be addressed by every college course, but especially in software engineering.  I've created a course built to teach these skills and invite other teachers to help me refine the practices to create a sort of design pattern for teaching technology.

The CS 350 course seeks to teach students software engineering skills.   This is done by assigning the students to complete a real-world project that is patterned after a popular commercial application.

I presented the students with eight applications to select and the 16 students were assigned to one of four applications patterned after:

- Amazon.com
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- Trello

The goal is to have students learn software engineering by participating in a complex engineering project where they need to embrace multiple engineering skills to succeed.

This class is not a lecture based class - it is a project-focused one.  To provide proper pacing of such a large project (and prevent procrastination) I have divided the semester into 7 Milestones.  Every two weeks students are expected to produce results that illustrate the required skill.

While details of these skills are not always available at the beginning of the milestone period, I am providing verbal guidance early for each milestone.  The students are not penalized if they do not deliver the desired content by the expected date.

I give the student written feedback about how they did in each milestone and explain the additional work that I need for them to pass the milestone.  I recognize that everyone works at a different pace and I am extremely flexible about how they achieve the desired result.

I am very clear about the grade reflecting the progress so far and that every student can complete the work for full credit up to the last day of class.  Students each have a unique roles assigned for every milestone (Requirements, Design, Code, Test).  These assignments rotate so that each student has the opportunity to learn each role.

Different students have unique learning and work styles and I seek to let them find what works best for them.  By the end of the semester their grade will reflect the number of milestones that were successfully completed.

As a software engineer I have trained many young engineers and the CS 350 course seeks to create a realistic environment that each engineer will face at their first job.  While the project assignments are about completing project goals ,the teaching of concepts is also important.

I wrote the curriculum this year for this class, based on teaching this material twice before at UNC.  As an experienced software engineer, I felt that a fresh approach and materials were needed to train engineers in the required skills.

I have built an online textbook which is made available to the students as a website.  This textbook also includes links to the work that the students produce.  My interactive website contains links where students must create documents.

All assignments are submitted by committing code to a repository on Github.  This is important because the students are building a portfolio of their work that future employers will be able to access. 

The Software Engineering course costs $140, but I offer my students a 75% discount (to $35) to keep the cost low.  This fee replaces the need for students to buy a textbook (that often cost $200-$300). This material teaches the students the concepts they need and provides the specific requirements for each milestone of the project.  I have not been able to keep up with publishing the content as much as I would like but am always delivering the content timely enough to prevent delays.

Canvas is used to post the assignment requirements, and due dates (which are all  flexible), and grades.  Students can observe their progress throughout the semester.  Some students get discouraged when they fall behind so I try to encourage them to keep going.  Students will get a final grade based on the number of milestones that they completed. I am committed to working with each student to ensure an optimal outcome.

I have a software engineering company and am attempting to train students with enough skills that I would be willing to hire them.  I recognize that this class is unlike any other that students have encountered but I believe that this is the best way to give students a good foundation in software engineering.
