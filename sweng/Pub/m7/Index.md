# Milestone 7 - Product Upgrade

## Requirements

Milestone 7 of the project involves planning the first product upgrade. The first job responsibility is to create a plan
for Release 1.1, which includes fixing defects, enhancing existing features, and building new capabilities. To update a
commercial application start by selecting three defects, three enhancements, and three new features to address.

Customer engagement and product reviews should also be a priority, ensuring that the product is meeting customer needs
and expectations. Additionally, the task involves using AI prompts to suggest fixes for defects, explain the details of
enhancements, and describe the details of new features. 


## Design

The design responsibility for Milestone 7 involves reporting on data management policies and devops. It is important to
create a plan for how to work with data, including backup policies, migration policies, test servers, approval process,
performance monitoring, and a scaling plan. In addition, AI prompts can be used to generate a report for the devops
policies, explain how to scale software servers to handle more users, and describe the monitoring software to use.

Data management is a critical aspect of the project. The data management plan should include a backup policy, a migration	
policy, a test server, an approval process, a performance monitoring plan, and a scaling plan. AI prompts can be used to
generate a report for the devops policies, explain how to scale software servers to handle more users, and describe the
monitoring software to use.


## Code

The coding aspect of the project includes creating a user-friendly website for users, updating the user guide for
Release 1.1, and developing a 10-minute tour of the software. AI prompts can assist by outlining the pages for a website
to train users, creating a webpage that explains the primary benefit of the application, and developing an FAQ for the
app.


## Test

During Milestone 7 the testing should focus on security. The responsibilities include creating a security review
checklist, a security assessment report, and an engineering investment summary. AI prompts can be utilized to build a
security checklist for the specific application on a designated platform, create a manual explaining the security
policies, and develop a sign off form for the security checklist.
