# Lesson 21 - Planning a Product Upgrade

In this job assignment, your task is to focus on the requirements work that needs to be done for Milestone 7 of the
product upgrade. Your responsibilities will include planning a product upgrade, fixing defects, enhancing existing
features, building new capabilities, and engaging with customers for product reviews. Let's dive into the details!


## Planning a Product Upgrade

The first step in the requirements work for Milestone 7 is to plan the product upgrade. This involves evaluating the
current state of the product and identifying areas that need improvement. You will be responsible for creating a
detailed plan for Release 1.1, which includes the following components:

1. Fix defects: Identify at least three defects in the current version of the product. For each defect, explain the
   suggested fix using AI prompts. Consider the impact of these defects on the overall user experience and prioritize
   them accordingly.

2. Enhance existing features: Identify at least three existing features that can be enhanced to provide a better user
   experience or improve performance. For each enhancement, explain the details using AI prompts. Think about how these
   enhancements can add value to the product and align with the needs of the users.

3. Build new capabilities: Identify at least three new features or capabilities that can be added to the product to meet
   the evolving market demands or address user feedback. For each new feature, explain the details using AI prompts.
   Consider the feasibility and potential impact of these new capabilities on the overall product value.

## Commercial Application Development

Once the planning phase is complete, you will move on to the implementation phase. In this part of the job assignment,
you will be involved in commercial application development. You are required to select three commercial applications and
work on their development using the requirements gathered during the planning phase. 

Ensure that you adhere to best practices in commercial application development. This includes writing clean and
maintainable code, following coding standards, and conducting regular code reviews. Keep in mind the specific
requirements and constraints of each commercial application to ensure successful delivery.

## Customer Engagement and Product Reviews

Engaging with customers and gathering their feedback is crucial to the success of any product upgrade. As part of this
job assignment, your task is to actively engage with customers and encourage them to provide product reviews. 

You will be responsible for collecting customer feedback, analyzing it, and identifying any gaps or areas of improvement
that need to be addressed in the next milestone. Use this feedback to iteratively improve the product and ensure that it
aligns with the needs and expectations of the customers.


## AI Prompts

To perform the requirements work effectively, the following AI prompts should be used:

- For the identified defects, explain a suggested fix using AI prompts. Consider the impact of these defects on the
  overall user experience and prioritize them accordingly.
- For the enhancements to existing features, explain the details using AI prompts. Think about how these enhancements
  can add value to the product and align with the needs of the users.
- For the new features or capabilities, explain the details using AI prompts. Consider the feasibility and potential
  impact of these new capabilities on the overall product value.

Remember to document all the details and decisions made during the requirements work. These documents will serve as
valuable references for future upgrades and improvements to the product.
