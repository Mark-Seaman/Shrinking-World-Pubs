# Lesson 29 - Productivity and Learning

## Overview

The goal of this lesson is to learn how to improve productivity by learning. The lesson will cover the following topics: 

* Lifelong learning
* 50 Skills to produce a web app
* Quantified learning over time
* Link to productivity
* Your value to the company


## Lifelong Learning

Lifelong learning is the ticket to success.  Whatever you know will not be enough to carry you forward.  You must learn
new skills and knowledge to keep up with the changing world.  

Engineers should keep a list of the top skills they need to learn.  This list should be updated every year.  The list
should be prioritized and the top 5 skills should be the focus of learning. 

What you will learn in the next year will be more important than what you already know.  The skills you learn will be
the most important factor in your success.  The skills you learn will determine your value to the company.


## 50 Skills to Produce a Web App

To create a software application typically requires 50 skills.  If you are missing any of these skills, you will need to
learn them. But as you learn these skills, you will be able to easily build a software application.  

Each application that you build is about 90% the same as the previous application.  The 10% that is different is the new
features that you are adding.  The 90% that is the same requires skills that you have already learned.

Each new technical skill requires about 10 hours of learning.   You need to try a lot of things before you understand
how to use the skill.  You need to try a lot of things before you understand how to apply the skill to your application.

For those skills that you already have pacticed many times, you can use them without thinking.  You have already learned
how to use them.  You can quickly apply them to your application.  Any skill that you have used 10 times or more times can
be applied in about an hour.

If the typical application requires 50 skills, then you can build a new application in about 50 hours if all of the
skills have been mastered.  But each new skill will require about 10 hours of learning.  So the first application will
take about 500 hours to build.  The second application will take about 100 hours to build.  The third application will
take about 50 hours.


## Quantified Learning over Time

![Learning Curve](img/Productivity.png)

The learning curve shows how the time spent learning decreases over time.  The first time you try a new skill, all of your
time is spent learning.  You are not productive.  But as you practice the skill, you become more productive.  You can
apply the skill without thinking.  You can apply the skill in about an hour.

As you learn more skills, you become more productive.  Over time you spend a smaller percentage of your time learning and
a larger percentage of your time applying your skills.  You become more productive.  You can build applications faster.

My experience is that there is an exponential relationship between the skills learned and my productivity.  This means
that there is a 1/2 life for the time spent learning.  To effectively double my productivity requires about 1000 hours of
practice.


## Link to Productivity

The learning curve shows that the time spent learning decreases over time. Each person will learn at a different rate but
the curve will be the same.

My productivity is doubled as the amount of time spent learning decreases.  I believe that this is based on reducing the
remaining lack of knowledge.  As I learn more, I have less to learn.  

Realistically, it takes about a year to get 1,000 hours of practice on a technology. This translates into the following
productivity curve for a three year period trend.

**3 Year Productivity Trend**

* Year 1 - 25% productivity
* Year 2 - 65% productivity
* Year 3 - 80% productivity


## Your Value to the Company

Average salaries in the Denver area for junior software engineers is between $60,000 and $100,000 per year.  
Imagine that you are a software engineer just starting, and are paid $60,000 per year.  You are 25% productive compared
to an experienced engineer making $10,000.  This means that you are worth $25,000 per year to the company.  You are paid
$60,000 per year.  This means that the company is losing $35,000 the first year.

But as your skill grows, your productivity increases.  After 3 years, you are 80% productive.  This means that you are
worth $80,000 per year to the company.  You are now paid $66,000 per year.  This means that the company is making $14,000
from your work.  You are now a valuable asset to the company.

When companies hire new engineers, they are making an investment.  They are investing in the growth of the engineer and
ultimately the growth of the company.   If you are not investing your time in learning, you are not growing and will never
be a valuable asset to the company.


## Summary

Investing in your learning is the best investment you can make.  The more you learn, the more valuable you become.
As you follow the learning curve your productivity rises.  Your primary asset is not your current knowledge but your
ability to learn.

This is most true for software engineers in the early part of the curve.  What you will do over the next two years 
will determine the success that you will acheive over your entire career.   Make learning a priority.  Attempt to learn
a major new technology each year.

The more you grow the further you will go.  The more you learn the more you will earn.  The more you learn the more you
will be able to contribute to the success of the company.  The more you learn the more valuable you will be to the company.
