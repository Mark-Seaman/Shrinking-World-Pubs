# Project - Design Role


## Project Overview

For Milestone 7, our focus is on product upgrade and design. We need to ensure that our data management policies and
DevOps strategies are robust and efficient. Additionally, we need to create a comprehensive plan for working with data
that covers backup, migration policies, test servers, approval process, performance monitoring, and scaling.

## Report on Data Management Policies and DevOps Strategies

You are responsible for creating a detailed report that outlines our data management policies and DevOps strategies.
This report should include best practices for data backup, migration, test servers, approval process, performance
monitoring, and scaling. Provide clear explanations and examples to illustrate the importance and practicality of these
policies.

## Plan for Working with Data

You are also tasked with developing a well-defined plan for working with data. This plan should cover all aspects
mentioned above: backup, migration policies, test servers, approval process, performance monitoring, and scaling.
Provide step-by-step instructions and guidelines for each process, considering the specific needs and requirements of
our project. Include relevant tools and technologies that can facilitate the implementation of this plan.
