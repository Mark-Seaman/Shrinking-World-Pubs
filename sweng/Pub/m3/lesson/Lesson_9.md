# Lesson 9 - Milestone 3 - Requirements

## Agile Software Engineering

Agile software development is a modern approach to software development that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional software development methodologies, such as the Waterfall model, which often led to lengthy and rigid development processes. The history of Agile software development and its principles can be summarized as follows:

**History of Agile Software Development:**

1. **1970s-1980s:** The roots of Agile can be traced back to various software development methodologies developed during this period, including Rapid Application Development (RAD), Scrum, and various iterative and incremental approaches. These methodologies emphasized faster development cycles and customer involvement.

2. **1990s:** The Agile movement gained momentum in the 1990s, with notable events and publications:
   
   - **DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method)** was introduced in 1994, focusing on iterative and incremental development.
   
   - **Scrum** was formalized in the mid-1990s by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. Scrum emphasizes small, self-organizing teams and short development cycles called Sprints.

   - **Extreme Programming (XP)**, introduced by Kent Beck in the late 1990s, promoted practices like test-driven development, continuous integration, and frequent customer feedback.

3. **Manifesto for Agile Software Development (2001):** A significant milestone in Agile's history was the publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001. Seventeen prominent software developers and thought leaders met in Snowbird, Utah, and crafted the manifesto, which outlined the guiding principles of Agile development. The Agile Manifesto values:

   - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
   - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
   - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
   - **Responding to change** over following a plan.

   While the manifesto values the items on the right, it values the items on the left more. This shift in mindset represented a fundamental change in how software development was approached.

4. **Agile Frameworks and Practices:** Following the Agile Manifesto, various frameworks and practices were developed and refined, including Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, and Lean, among others. These approaches all align with the Agile principles and offer specific guidelines for implementing Agile methodologies.

**Key Principles of Agile Software Development:**

The Agile Manifesto provides the foundation for Agile principles, but the Agile community has expanded on these principles over time. Some of the key principles of Agile software development include:

1. **Customer Collaboration:** Agile development involves continuous collaboration with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and priorities. Feedback from customers is incorporated throughout the development process.

2. **Iterative and Incremental Development:** Agile projects are divided into small, manageable iterations or increments. At the end of each iteration, a potentially shippable product increment is delivered. This approach allows for flexibility and early value delivery.

3. **Cross-Functional Teams:** Agile teams are typically small and cross-functional, meaning they have all the necessary skills and roles (developers, testers, designers, etc.) to complete a task or feature without dependencies on external teams.

4. **Embracing Change:** Agile welcomes changing requirements, even late in the development process. Changes are seen as opportunities to provide better value to customers.

5. **Frequent Deliveries:** Agile teams aim to deliver working software frequently, often in short cycles. This allows for quick validation of ideas and keeps the product in sync with changing customer needs.

6. **Continuous Improvement:** Agile teams continuously reflect on their processes and seek ways to improve. This includes regular retrospectives to identify what went well and what needs to change.

7. **Empowerment and Self-Organization:** Team members are empowered to make decisions and self-organize. Agile leaders provide support and guidance but trust the team to make the best choices.

8. **Quality Focus:** Agile emphasizes delivering high-quality software by incorporating testing and quality assurance throughout the development process.

9. **Visibility and Transparency:** Agile teams maintain transparency through open communication and the use of visual tools like Kanban boards or Scrum boards to track progress.

10. **Simplicity:** Agile teams strive for simplicity in design and development, avoiding unnecessary complexity that can hinder progress.

11. **Deliver Value:** The primary goal of Agile development is to deliver value to customers. Teams prioritize work based on its perceived value and focus on delivering features that provide the most benefit.

These Agile principles guide the behavior and mindset of Agile teams, fostering collaboration, adaptability, and a focus on delivering customer-centric solutions. Agile has become a widely adopted approach in software development, and its principles have also influenced practices in other domains, including project management and product development.


## Scrum

Ken Schwaber is one of the co-creators of Scrum and a prominent figure in the Agile community.

Scrum is a framework for agile product development that brings together people, their interactions, and the products they create. It's a lightweight, adaptable approach to managing complex work, inspired by the principles of empiricism.

At the heart of Scrum is the Scrum Team, composed of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and the Development Team. These roles work collaboratively to deliver valuable increments of work in short iterations known as Sprints.

The Product Owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the work in the Product Backlog, a dynamic list of requirements, features, and improvements. They represent the interests of stakeholders, ensuring the team focuses on the most valuable work.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader who supports the team in embracing and applying Scrum principles. They help the team remove impediments, facilitate meetings, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

The Development Team is a cross-functional group of professionals responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each Sprint. They self-organize, decide how to accomplish their work, and collaborate closely with stakeholders.

Sprints are time-boxed iterations, typically lasting two to four weeks, during which the Development Team builds, tests, and delivers a potentially shippable increment of the product. The goal is to create a "Done" increment of work, meaning it meets the team's definition of done and is ready for release.

Scrum employs a set of events, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, to enable transparency, inspection, and adaptation. These events help the team stay aligned, inspect their progress, and adjust their approach as necessary.

Transparency, inspection, and adaptation are the pillars of Scrum. Teams regularly inspect their work and adapt based on feedback and changing circumstances. This empirical approach ensures that the product evolves in response to real-world needs and feedback.

Ultimately, Scrum is not just a set of roles, events, and artifacts. It's a mindset and a way of working that empowers teams to deliver value incrementally and respond effectively to change. It's about fostering collaboration, delivering quality, and continuously improving to meet the ever-changing demands of the market.
