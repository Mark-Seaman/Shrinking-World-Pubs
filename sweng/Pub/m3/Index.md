# Milestone 3: Functional Prototype

The goal of Milestone 3 is to build a functional prototype of the product. 
This requires the team to implement the bulk of the functionality.  
By the milestone 3 checkpoint the application should be usable for the
purpose that it was designed for.  There may be many missing features but
the app should be working.
