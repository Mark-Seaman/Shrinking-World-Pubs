## notes

Finals week   -- celebrate

I've been at UNC for five years

- Built three video courses - textbook
- 9 semesters - 16 sections
- Over 400 students in web dev
- Software for Digital Classroom

I spent many years in corporate software development

Teaching is the highlight of my career

I love watching students learn

I am hoping to continue to invest in some form of teaching for the foreseeable future.
