# Common Mistakes When Using AI

If you are new to using artificial intelligence (AI) in your projects, it can be easy to assume that
AI will do all of the work for you. However, this is a common misconception. In this article, we
will discuss some of the most common mistakes people make when using AI and how to avoid them.

AI is an excellent tool when used correctly. By avoiding these common mistakes, you
can reap the benefits of AI and create high-quality work. Remember, AI is not a substitute for
human expertise and guidance.


## Mistake #1 - Thinking the AI Will Do Your Project

AI can be a powerful tool, but it is important to keep in mind that humans still need to provide
guidance for the AI to be effective. Don't abdicate your responsibility as the project manager.
Humans require guidance, and so does AI. Without proper direction, AI can produce garbage
instantly. Working with AI requires a partnership and collaboration.

## Mistake #2 - Unclear Project Goals

If you don't know what you need to say, the AI will make something up, and you will produce trash.
Use AI to brainstorm, but always build a top-level outline by hand. Let the AI hydrate the outline.
This way, you can ensure that the AI is working towards the right objectives, and you can avoid
ending up with subpar work.

## Mistake #3 - Poor Prompt Engineering

To maximize the benefits AI can bring, you need to write clear and concise prompts. As an
experienced teacher with a friendly style, create an outline with three levels about the ideas you
want to convey. Write a paragraph for each point in this outline, and output the text in markdown
format.

## Mistake #4 - Lack of Project Storyboard

To avoid feeling overwhelmed or lost, approach your project with a dev workflow - learn, plan,
build, teach. Progress step by step and use AI to guide each step. Say what you know and ask for AI
to expand. By creating a storyboard of your project, you can keep track of your progress and ensure
that you are moving towards your goals.
