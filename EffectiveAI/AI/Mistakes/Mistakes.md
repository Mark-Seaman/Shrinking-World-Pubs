# Common Mistakes When Using AI

If you are new to using artificial intelligence (AI) in your projects, it can be easy to assume that
AI will do all of the work for you. However, this is a common misconception. In this article, we
will discuss some of the most common mistakes people make when using AI and how to avoid them.

AI is an excellent tool when used correctly. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can reap the
benefits of AI and create high-quality work. Remember, AI is not a substitute for human expertise
and guidance.



## Mistake #1 - AI Won't Do Your Work

AI allows you to create trash with no effort at all.  Putting words on a page is no longer the
definition of success. ChatGPT can actually do some amazing things but requires real knowledge
and human intelligence to get it to produce high-quality results.

If you've ever thought that handing over your project to AI would make it more efficient or save you
time and effort, think again. While AI can certainly be powerful and useful, it's not a replacement
for human guidance and expertise. In fact, expecting AI to do all the work for you could actually
lead to more problems than solutions.

First of all, it's important to remember that AI is only as good as the data it's trained on. If you
feed it low-quality data or ask it to do something beyond its capabilities, you'll get garbage
output. This can be especially risky if you're relying on AI to make important decisions or
automate complex tasks.

Furthermore, working with AI requires a partnership between human and machine. It's not enough to
just expect the AI to handle everything on its own. You need to be involved every step of the way,
from selecting the right content and building prompts to checking the output for errors and bias.

And finally, it's worth acknowledging that AI is not a replacement for human creativity or
intuition. While AI can certainly help with tasks like data analysis or language translation, it
can't replicate the kind of critical thinking and problem-solving skills that come from years of
experience and expertise. That's why it's important to view AI not as a replacement for human work,
but as a tool to enhance and augment it.

So next time you're tempted to hand over your project to AI and let it do all the work, remember:
don't abdicate! Working effectively with AI requires a collaborative and informed approach that
values human input and expertise.



## Mistake #2 - Unclear Project Goals

As a teacher, writer, or software developer, it's not easy to deal with project goals that are vague
or poorly defined. You may end up producing subpar work, or even worse, complete waste.
Fortunately, there are ways to prevent this from happening. 

Firstly, you should avoid leaving everything to the AI. While automatic tools can be a valuable
asset in generating ideas and suggestions, relying on them exclusively can lead to incoherent
messes. You should also leave room for human intervention, as it is essential to evaluate the goals
and make sure they are valid and achievable. 

Secondly, brainstorming with an AI is a viable strategy, but you must have a top-level outline
constructed manually. A top-level outline will give the AI a sense of direction, which it can then
analyze and refine. You must design a workflow that allows you to prompt the AI for initial ideas
and then review and rewrite the content to match the needs of the project.

Lastly, the AI can be used to hydrate the outline. Once you have the top-level outline, you may now
use the AI to enhance it by providing detailed information to it. Once you have detailed
information, and a clear outline, you are ready to start your project.

It is essential to establish clear and defined goals for your project to avoid
confusion. In conclusion, you can achieve this by utilizing automatic tools like AI to help you
with the brainstorming stage, always building a top-level outline manually and then allowing the AI
to improve it.



## Mistake #3 - Poor Prompt Engineering in AI

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize different industries, it is vital to
understand how it works. Simply put, the AI does its task by completing a thought that you start
with a prompt. The AI thinks about the prompted subject and gives an answer that is typical of the
content it found in the training documents. 

However, it is not always that easy to get the desired result from an AI-generated response. That is
where Prompt Engineering comes in. Prompt engineering is the practice of learning how to prompt the
AI to produce the results you want. It involves carefully crafting the prompts. 

There are several parts of a prompt that can be used to manage the AI-generated response. Firstly,
it is essential to set up the personality and voice to achieve the desired outcome. For example, if
you want the AI to give friendly explanations, the prompt can be set up to convey that. 

The output format of the AI's response should also be considered. If the output is in the form of
markdown text or CSV data, the prompt has to be structured according to that. Setting the context
of the prompt is necessary, especially when teaching a specific subject. For instance, when
teaching Python to high school students, the prompt should be geared towards that context. When
writing about the climate crisis, the prompt should be tailored to cover that topic. 

Lastly, prompts should assign specific tasks to the AI. This creates direction, and it becomes
easier to obtain the desired results. Whether it's creating an outline with three levels about
specific ideas or writing a paragraph for each point in an outline, clear tasks keep the AI
focused. It is essential to build a library of reusable prompts to ensure consistent results when
using the AI. 

In summary, prompt engineering is an essential aspect of AI technology, especially when using it for
teaching or any other industry. Adequately crafting the prompt can produce results that meet your
requirements, whether it's teaching Python or writing about the future of climate.



## Mistake #4 - Lack of Project Storyboard

Every project goes through a series of development steps.  Whether you are working on writing a
book, creating a course, or developing a software application there are common patterns needed to
product the result.  

Every book, course, or software app is built in components that must be integrated together.  Each
component will also be developed through a series of stages that appear very different from one
another.

Film makers have been using storyboards for years to outline the progression of scenes in the
script. Then each scene can be built and integrated together to make the seamless whole. The
storyboard provides the high level view of the action taking place.

I use this concept of a storyboard in my writing projects to capture the development stages of the
content progression of a single component.  For example, a chapter in a book will start off and a
concept or set of idea and culminate with the published content.

A simple storyboard might look like:

* Ideas
* Outline
* Draft
* Editing revisions
* Review revisions
* Published result

No matter what the project is, this development pattern works.  I use it for preparing lessons in a
course, modules within a software application, and chapters in a book. 

A lack of storyboard can be detrimental to the entire process. To ensure a smooth development
workflow, it's essential to follow a few key steps. These steps include learning, planning,
building, and teaching.

This become even more important when working with an AI.  By mapping out the storyboard each step
can be planned and executed with the AI.  A prompt to ChatGPT results in text output which must be
read and revised by a human.  This should happen at each stage of the storyboard to ensure that the
AI is moving in the right direction.

Completing each of the six steps listed is done in partnership with the human and AI working
together closely.  If you try to do too much in one step you will either create garbage or spend a
lot of wasted time fixing the output from the AI.

Every step can benefit from using AI, but you must be clear about what you want the AI to do for
you.  Steering every interaction is absolutely essential to get the result you need.

Use this model repeatedly:

* Plan the next step in the development
* Assess the content that will be the starting point for the next step
* Create an AI prompt to set the context for drafting that step
* Review the content
* Edit to realign with your vision of the project
* Repeat until this component is done
* Save all your AI prompts for later
