# Common Mistakes when using AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly popular tool in the tech industry, with many
businesses and individuals employing its services to help them complete projects more efficiently.
However, there are some common mistakes that people make when using AI that can lead to subpar
results. Here are some things to keep in mind when using AI to help with your projects.

AI can be a powerful tool for completing projects more efficiently. However, to get
the best results, it's important to avoid common pitfalls and work closely with the AI to ensure
that it is aligned with your goals. By following the steps outlined above, you can use AI to your
advantage and create high-quality content that meets your needs and helps you achieve success in
your projects.


## 1 - Thinking the AI will do your project

One of the biggest mistakes people make when working with AI is assuming that the tool will do all
the work for them. While AI can be a powerful tool, it still requires guidance and direction from
human experts. Abdicating responsibility to the AI will not result in a successful project.
Instead, working with AI requires a partnership and collaboration between human expertise and
machine learning. Be sure to provide the AI with clear direction and work closely with it
throughout the project to ensure the best possible results.

Another mistake people make is assuming that AI will create high-quality content instantly. While AI
can work quickly, it still requires guidance to ensure that the output is of high quality. Without
proper direction, the AI may create garbage content that is useless for its intended purpose.

## 2 - Unclear project goals

Another common mistake people make when using AI is having unclear project goals. If you don't know
what you need to say, the AI will make something up, and you will produce trash. To ensure that you
get the best results from AI, it's essential to have a clear understanding of your project goals.
Use AI to brainstorm ideas and create a list of potential topics or themes for your project. Then,
take the time to build a top-level outline by hand that clearly outlines the goals of your project.
This will give the AI a clear understanding of what you're trying to achieve and help it to create
content that is aligned with your goals.

## 3 - Poor Prompt Engineering

Another common mistake people make when using AI is poor prompt engineering. This refers to the
process of creating effective prompts that guide the AI towards the desired output. As an expert
teacher, you have a friendly style that can be invaluable in creating effective prompts that the AI
can understand. When creating prompts, it's essential to create an outline with three levels that
clearly outlines the structure of the project. Then, write a paragraph for each point in the
outline, clearly explaining what you want the AI to accomplish at each step. Finally, output the
markdown text so that the AI can understand your prompts effectively.

## 4 - Lack of Project Storyboard

Finally, another common mistake people make when using AI is a lack of a project storyboard. Having
a detailed project storyboard is essential for success when using AI. The dev workflow model
involves learning, planning, building, and teaching. Progressing step by step while using AI to
guide each step helps you to integrate the AI into your workflow effectively. It's also important
to say what you know and then ask the AI to expand on your knowledge. This way, you're taking the
lead on the project, and the AI is there to help you achieve your goals.
