## Poor Prompt Engineering in AI

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize different industries, it is vital to understand how it works. Simply put, the AI does its task by completing a thought that you start with a prompt. The AI thinks about the prompted subject and gives an answer that is typical of the content it found in the training documents. 

However, it is not always that easy to get the desired result from an AI-generated response. That is where Prompt Engineering comes in. Prompt engineering is the practice of learning how to prompt the AI to produce the results you want. It involves carefully crafting the prompts. 

There are several parts of a prompt that can be used to manage the AI-generated response. Firstly, it is essential to set up the personality and voice to achieve the desired outcome. For example, if you want the AI to give friendly explanations, the prompt can be set up to convey that. 

The output format of the AI's response should also be considered. If the output is in the form of markdown text or CSV data, the prompt has to be structured according to that. Setting the context of the prompt is necessary, especially when teaching a specific subject. For instance, when teaching Python to high school students, the prompt should be geared towards that context. When writing about the climate crisis, the prompt should be tailored to cover that topic. 

Lastly, prompts should assign specific tasks to the AI. This creates direction, and it becomes easier to obtain the desired results. Whether it's creating an outline with three levels about specific ideas or writing a paragraph for each point in an outline, clear tasks keep the AI focused. It is essential to build a library of reusable prompts to ensure consistent results when using the AI. 

In summary, prompt engineering is an essential aspect of AI technology, especially when using it for teaching or any other industry. Adequately crafting the prompt can produce results that meet your requirements, whether it's teaching Python or writing about the future of climate.
