# Common Mistakes when using AI

1 - Thinking the AI will do your project

- AI will not do your work - don't abdicate!
- Humans require guidance and so does AI
- AI lets you create garbage instantly
- Working with AI requires a partnership and collaboration

2 - Unclear project goals

- If you don't know what you need to say the AI will make something up and you will produce trash
- Use AI to brainstorm
- Always build a top-level outline by hand
- Let the AI hydrate the outline

3 - Poor Prompt Engineering

- You are an expert teacher with a friendly style
- Create an outine with three levels about these ideas
- Write a paragraph for each point in this outline
- Output markdown text

4 - Lack of Project Storyboard

- Dev Workflow - Learn, Plan, Build, Teach
- Progress step by step
- Use AI to guide each step
- Say what you know and ask for AI to expand
