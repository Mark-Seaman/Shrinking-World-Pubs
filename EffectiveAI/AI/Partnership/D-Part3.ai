3 - Poor Prompt Engineering

- AI performs its task by completely a thought that you start with a prompt
- The AI thinks about the prompted subject and gives an answer that is typical of content it found
in the training documents.
- Prompt Engineering is the practice of learning how to prompt the AI to produce the results you
want.
- Parts of the prompt
    - Set up the personality and voice
        - eg. You are an expert teacher with a friendly style
    - Control the format or the output 
        - eg. markdown text, CSV data
    - Set a content context
        - eg. Teaching Python to highschool students
        - eg. Climate crisis
    - Assign a task
        - eg. Create an outline with three levels about these ideas
        - eg. Write a paragraph for each point in this outline
- Build a library of reusable prompts


Write a teaching article with around 250 words by expanding each bullet into a paragraph.

Output as markdown.
