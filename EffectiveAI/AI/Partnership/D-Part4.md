## Lack of Project Storyboard

Every project goes through a series of development steps.  Whether you are working on writing a
book, creating a course, or developing a software application there are common patterns needed
to product the result.  

Every book, course, or software app is built in components that must be integrated together.  Each
component will also be developed through a series of stages that appear very different from one 
another.

Film makers have been using storyboards for years to outline the progression of scenes in the script.
Then each scene can be built and integrated together to make the seamless whole. The storyboard 
provides the high level view of the action taking place.

I use this concept of a storyboard in my writing projects to capture the development stages of the
content progression of a single component.  For example, a chapter in a book will start off and a 
concept or set of idea and culminate with the published content.

A simple storyboard might look like:

* Ideas
* Outline
* Draft
* Editing revisions
* Review revisions
* Published result

No matter what the project is, this development pattern works.  I use it for preparing lessons in
a course, modules within a software application, and chapters in a book. 

A lack of storyboard can be detrimental to the entire
process. To ensure a smooth development workflow, it's essential to follow a few key steps. These
steps include learning, planning, building, and teaching.

This become even more important when working with an AI.  By mapping out the storyboard each step
can be planned and executed with the AI.  A prompt to ChatGPT results in text output which must be
read and revised by a human.  This should happen at each stage of the storyboard to ensure that
the AI is moving in the right direction.

Completing each of the six steps listed is done in partnership with the human and AI working 
together closely.  If you try to do too much in one step you will either create garbage or spend
a lot of wasted time fixing the output from the AI.

Every step can benefit from using AI, but you must be clear about what you want the AI to do for 
you.  Steering every interaction is absolutely essential to get the result you need.

Use this model repeatedly:

* Plan the next step in the development
* Assess the content that will be the starting point for the next step
* Create an AI prompt to set the context for drafting that step
* Review the content
* Edit to realign with your vision of the project
* Repeat until this component is done
* Save all your AI prompts for later
