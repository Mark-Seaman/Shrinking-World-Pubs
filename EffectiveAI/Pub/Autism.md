# How Autism and AI Work for Me

As someone who is autistic, I have always found it challenging to communicate and express my ideas
effectively. It took me a long time to come to terms with my diagnosis and to understand how it
affects me in my daily life. However, as I started working in the field of artificial intelligence
(AI), I began to realize that my unique way of thinking and processing information was actually an
advantage in this field.

Working alongside many engineers, I quickly realized that autism is not uncommon in the tech
industry. In fact, many of my colleagues also have autism, which has allowed me to feel more
comfortable and accepted in my workplace. One of the most significant advantages of my autism is my
extraordinary focus. I am able to concentrate on a particular task for extended periods without
getting distracted, which is a valuable skill in the AI field.

Furthermore, AI has allowed me to express my ideas more effectively. Working with an AI writing
partner, I can easily share my thoughts and ideas, which can be instantly elaborated on and refined
by the AI. This collaborative approach has allowed me to produce a higher quality and quantity of
work than I could have achieved on my own.

In the past, I struggled to communicate my ideas effectively, often getting lost in tangents or
failing to articulate my point clearly. However, working with AI has allowed me to overcome these
challenges. The AI can help me to structure my thoughts and refine my writing, enabling me to
express my ideas more clearly and coherently.

Overall, I believe that AI and autism work hand in hand for me. My autism gives me a unique
perspective and skillset that is highly valuable in the AI field, and AI provides me with the tools
and support I need to express my ideas effectively. Working together, AI and autism allow me to
produce high-quality work and make a valuable contribution to the industry.
