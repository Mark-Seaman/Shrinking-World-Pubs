# My Mission

In the limited opportunity that I have left, I must carefully select opportunities that are a good
fit for God's calling.  I believe that I have been created to fulfill a destiny that is reflected
in the passions that drive me.    Four core issues define success.  To finish well I
must invest my energy into these areas.

There are many good goals that I view as a distraction to fulfilling my destiny.  While these goals
may be central to others, the demands of God's will for me require that I ignore them.  I must
search instead for the unique invitation that God is offering (pearl of great price,  lost
treasure, kingdom of God, heavenly prize).


## Transformation

I am not like Christ.  This simple truth has taken me years to understand and appreciate. God is at
work in me to change me from the inside out (a complete overhaul). My emotions and will are the
battleground where the Spirit engages me.   I desire to cling to immaturity and rebellion against
God's will. Honesty and courage are required to see the truth about my humanity and it is essential
to Christ's redemption. This is a lifetime journey where God slowly changes my values and desires.


## Technology

I have always been an innovator and believe that technology must be used for good. For most of my
church life, I have felt like I've been swimming upstream.  The prevailing thought is that
tradition is good and disruptive innovation is bad. The world is broken and we must actively work
using all of the creative problem-solving at our disposal. Technology is power.  In the hands of
evil people it is evil, while in God's hands it is divine. We must use technology to make the world a
better place.


## Missions

Culture blinds us in certain ways. Every culture carries both good and evil. I have always been an
outsider and alien in middle-class white America.  This makes me a "Third-Culture Person", having
an outsider's viewpoint on my own culture. I have a deep desire to help redeem what is broken in
our society.  Years of nationalism and the pandemic have brought corruption into the church. I feel
compelled to see restoration to God's will which can only come about by repentance. The life of
Christ must be incarnated as truth for our social context if it is to be received by our society.
This requires a missionary mindset.


## Teaching

Changing how people think has always been at the core of my life mission.  Learning and sharing best
practices are critical to my identity. The pen is mightier than the sword and I use writing as my
weapon of choice.  I am not very good at public speaking or private conversations. I have a deep
need to influence others, which requires that I first understand a topic. I spend a great deal of
my time learning and then feel compelled to teach what I have learned. Innovation is a common
theme that constantly emerges in my teaching.  How can we thrive in the modern world?  What does it
take to fully embrace reality and become who we were intended to be?
