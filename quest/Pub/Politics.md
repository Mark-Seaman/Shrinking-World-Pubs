# Colliding Empires
 
## The Persian Invasions

In ancient times Greece ruled the world.  The golden age offered a new level of philosophy, art,
invention, and prosperity.  This period of time lasted for a couple centuries but changed the world
forever.

The Greeks colonized the entire known world taking their culture with them. They also built
expansive cities such as Athens, which was the center of cosmopolitan life.

In 490 BC a series of Persian rulers (Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes), raised enormous armies and attempted
to[invade Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars) and subjugate it citizens.  At
a key moment the Spartans rallied a small army that blocked the Persian advance long enough for all
of the city states in Greece to deploy their soldiers. The Persians were defeated and the Spartans
became legend and the city-state of Athens ruled the oceans with it navy.


## Economic and social prosperity

This initiated a time of unparalleled prosperity and innovation.  The Greeks had stood up against
the most powerful army on earth and won.  Almost everyone at that time was farming, but people
began to congregate in towns and cities.

A major element of the success against Xerxes was the defeat of the Persian naval forces at Salamis.
There, the Persians allowed themselves to be boxed into a narrow passage and the Greeks set ships
afire and drove them into the Persian fleet.

Athens became the recognized leader of the world for the ship building industry. The naval
operations became that source of wealth through trade all across the Mediterranean and put Athens
at the center of worldwide trade routes.

With wealth pouring in culture prospered.  There was a shift in the lives of many people away from
agriculture and cities grew.  This time saw the emergence of poets, mathematicians, architects,
sculptures, philosophers, and potters.


## Politics

Classical Greece became the birthplace of democracy.  Much of what was lost after the decline of the
ancient world would be reborn in North America two thousand years later. These ideals of reason,
freedom, prosperity, and self-government that were present in Greece would eventually flow to the
rest of the world.

Athens emerged as the dominant city-state at the end of the Persian Wars. However, Athens was not
the only superpower around, and this would eventually end the high times.  Another city state
emerged that had a very different set of ideals.  Children in Sparta were raised from their
earliest years to serve the state.  The highest ideal was to become a member of the elite military
society known as the Peers.

Sparta was run by the military, not by a single man.  The Peers would appoint a person to function
as king, but the group really held the power.  Every male child was a potential warrior and every
other person was needed to feed and supply the army.  This is as close as the world has ever gotten
to a pure military society.

After the defeat of the Persians, Athens and Sparta were on a collision course, as two superpowers
are destined to be.  Athenians used their ships to consolidate their dominance in trade.  They
remind us of the expansion of the US after WW II: Unlimited opportunity through commercialization.
Democracy is a means to continue this prosperity.  It makes expansion and consolidation of wealth
and power sustainable for the long term.

Sparta would not allow it.  They were opposed to the very idea of the power and influence of Athens.
After all, they were the true heroes of the war against Xerxes.  If not for them everyone would be
speaking Persian now!  The thing that Sparta had on their side was the single-minded focus on
military might.  Sparta reminds me of the Soviet Union, where the people serve the military.


## Peloponnesian War (Athens vs. Sparta)

Conflict in the[Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War) happened in
small, isolated situations over a period of time.  There was a growing tension over control and
influence. When this escalation of conflict finally erupted into war it was no surprise to anyone.
In fact, everyone on both sides was clamoring to go to battle.  Over a period of a hundred years
the tensions kept getting worse.

Ultimately, the Athenians and Spartans would engage in thirty years of civil war. By the end of the
Peloponnesian Wars both sides were brought to ruin. People were starving and the plagues that
ravaged Athens were part of the byproduct of war.  The thriving civilization that was once Greece
was in tatters.

Years later Alexander would arise and command an army that would retaliate against the Persians, but
for now Greece was depleted.   What a loss for the world.

This conflict embodies the ideals that are at the heart of many conflicts throughout history.
Control versus Freedom.  This is at the root of many wars and even the political tension that we
often feel today.  No society can prosper for long unless it can hold the tension between the needs
of control and freedom.

Societies that focus exclusively on control eventually believe that the biggest treat is from
rebellion.  They put an inordinate amount of effort into controlling the behavior and eventually
the thoughts of the people. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that culminates in their
demise.  People will not be oppressed forever without rising up.

Freedom lovers tend toward anarchy.  The ideal of everyone doing what they want may turn into the
rich and powerful defining ways for themselves to get more freedom, while limiting the opportunity
of others. Rebellion is never a form of government.  The world has seen too many rebellions that
slid directly into dictatorships.


## Lessons from History

There are very many lessons that can be learned from this period of history. At this moment we stand
at a crossroads in our home history.   It is worth studying how others handled their situations to
understand our opportunities and dangers.

Here are several lessons that I think are worth pondering.

* War is never inevitable, but often the entire society sees it as the only viable solution to
  economic and social conflict.
* The ruling superpower does not want to make room for the emerging superpower(Athens and Sparta) so
  they go to war.  This situation has been repeated 16 times over history.  All but 4 plunged the
  world into war.
* This pattern exists today with the USA and China.  Read more about the[Thucydides Trap]
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides_Trap)
* A large scale war can ruin an entire civilization. Classic Greece was the most advanced
  civilization the world had known, but after 30 years of war was entirely depleted.


## Empires of the Bible

Understanding the empires of the world explains the time in which we
live.  The ancient empires functioned on the same principles that govern all empires
throughout history.

The Bible tells the story of three major empires that dominated world history for two thousand
years.  As we study all of recorded history we see that there has seldom been a time when world
affairs were not controlled by empires. Often, there were competing empires that controlled
different parts of the world at the same time.

Empires exist to concentrate wealth and power into the hands of the few people who are the ruling
class. When multiple empires interact with each other there is a high likelihood of conflict and
often war. In fact, the study of history is largely the study of empires and how they rise and fall.
Even the greatest empires eventually crumble.

The Egyptian empire was the dominant force in world politics between 2055 BC - 664 BC.  The empire
went through four distinct periods of development over its 1400 year supremacy.  Ramses the Great,
the builder of the pyramids, enslaved the Jewish population, died in 1213 BC.  He
embodies the ideals of a great empire, and in many ways serves as a prototype all the emperors
to come.

The Babylonian empire really encompasses multiple kingdoms and ethnic groups, that conquered each
over a period of 100 years.  Founded around 1800 BC the empire changed hands frequently from the
Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medes, and Persians. Nebuchadnezzar II (604 BC) marked the high
point of the empire.  Cyrus, the first Persian emperor, conquered Babylon in 539 BC. 

Nebuchadnezzar was the first to use the title "king of kings" to show that all other kings were
inferior and owed him fealty.  Attempted invasions of Greece under both Darius and Xerxes failed to
enforce the imperial demands.  Eventually Alexander the Great conquered the entire Persian empire
in 331 BC.  The glory days of the Babylonians really only lasted about 300 years, but the empire
existed for 1500 years.

Alexander the Great conquered most of the known world, all the way to India. After his death the
empire began to crumble and was gobbled up by Rome.  Julius Caesar and his successor Augustus
established the Roman empire that ruled most of the world from 43 BC for 500 years.  This morphed
into the Byzantine empire which lasted another 1000 years in the east (modern day Turkey).  It is
not unreasonable to think about the continuity from Alexander (331 BC) to the last of the Byzantine
emperors (1476 AD).  This is an 1800 year run of dominance.

These three ancient world empires have many similar characteristics that have been replicated by the
many empires that have come after them.  Let's take a look at several of the important aspects of
empires.

- Wealth - Empires increase wealth through trade and build infrastructure.
- Power - Empires consolidate power into the hands of a relatively small ruling class.
- Military - Empires must have a large military to crush rebellion and enlarge their borders. 
- Slavery - A large underclass creates cheap labor that enriches the empire.
- Food and Safety - The people live in peace as long as they server the emperor.
