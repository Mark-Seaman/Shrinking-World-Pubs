# Our Church Journey

## Born in Conflict

It is human nature to be overly concerned about our own well being while gleefully
ignoring the needs of other groups.  The more that people are unlike us, the
more we believe that they do not matter.

I joined the church in the middle of the 70s. At that time there was a huge amount of
generational conflict in the church.  This simply mirrored the conflict of
society that creating chaos across the world.  The church had become an 
institution that
was created and run by and for the previous generation.  And the largest 
generation (by percentage of population) was becoming adults in record 
numbers.

The church culture worked well for anyone over 50 but was quite irrelevant to
anyone under 30.  Young people were viewed with suspicion and required to adopt
the veneer and social protocols of the old folks. This culture was viewed as
largely out of touch with reality by the younger generation of young adults.

The environment was very uncomfortable to young people.  Everything from the
King James Bible to hymns that were written 500 years ago and meaningless
rituals devoid of real experience â€¦ it was completely alien to regular life. 
What brought comfort to old people repelled the young.

The young had a choice - either leave church life completely or build our own
church from scratch.  I was in the group that understood the critical value of
church to my personal journey in Christ.  I am also drawn to innovation and love
an adventure.


## Finding the Vineyard

During the 60s we saw the emergence of the charismatic renewal that brought
pentecostal practices into the mainline church.  During the mid 70s we saw the
Jesus People movement, with Chuck Smith at Calvary Chapel, gain tremendous
popularity. John Wimber extended this further to create a movement that combined
supernatural power with authentic relationships.  The Vineyard became known for
cultural relevance while preserving biblical integrity.

This is the stream that Stacie and I were drawn into at age 20. It embraced the
fundamental truths of the gospel while avoiding the weirdness that was so common
in the pentecostal and charismatic churches.  We examined each practice that was
a part of our life together and rejected anything that didn't work.  Over time
we innovated and redefined what church life would be by going all the way back
to models that we found in the early church.

This was happening all over the world.  It felt like we were part of the first
century church just trying to find our way.  The truths is, that we reinvented a
lot of things that we might have learned from the old church.  But because we
felt isolated and alienated from their practices and legalistic leaning we
discounted them as being irrelevant to our journey.

During this time the typical age within the Vineyard was between 20-40.  There
were a sprinkling of people in their 40s or 50s.  Most of our leaders were in
their 20s and 30s.  The main qualification for leadership was to be able to
support yourself while you pastored.  Very few pastors were full time.  Almost
all pastors worked full-time jobs outside the church.
