# Rule of Life


## Developing a Rule of Life

A rule of life is a strategic plan for a lifestyle of personal transformation. It seeks to outline
how time will be invested to engage in all of the areas that are important for spiritual growth and
development.

At the heart of the rule of life is a deep desire to experience God.  This is primarily about
learning to **Receive God's Love** and **Give Love** to others.

The rule of life outlines activities that are crucial to spiritual development.  It addresses four
key aspects of the spiritual life: Prayer, Rest, Relationships, Work.  Each of the areas have
activities that support the overall goals.

A regular review of each area is required to keep the plan consistent with the invitation of the
Spirit for my life.  I intend to develop each of these aspects into a set of objectives that outline
my understanding of God's intent for my life. Here is a sample of the highest level in my rule of
life.


## Worship - Moving toward God

This concept of worship for me goes far beyond singing songs.  It is about my experience of the
Spirit of God.  Without a personal connection with my living creator, I have little more than a
stale religion.  And this holds no interest.

At the heart of worship is my prayer life. During this time alone I truly connect with God's
presence in solitude, silence, and surrender.  My main practice is to sit quietly with God
and feel his nearness.  I express love and gratitude and also any heartbreak that I am dealing
with at the time.

I commit myself to his loving care and repent for anything that comes to mind.  Then I listen for
what God might be saying to me.  Mostly I just linger with God and enjoy being in his presence.

Sometimes I feel that God is prompting me to make changes in my life and I wrestle with whether I
truly want his will over my own.  My commitment to follow God is tested at this time and I do not
always give up on my desire to get my way.

My private life with God is intimate and forms the most essential foundation of my spiritual 
transformation. Without that intimacy, there would be nothing that would attract me to a religious
lifestyle.  

All Christian activity starts in that quiet place by feeling prompted to take action to 
be obedient.
 
    - Prayer - listening to God
    - Prophesy - speaking God's truth
    - Worship - in all its forms
    - Bible study - learning the truth
    - Spiritual Formation - growing in maturity
    - Learning - reading and seminars for personal development
    - Understanding - the world and culture


## Relationships - Moving toward Connection

I will never mature unless I learn to get along with people.  In fact, my relationships are the 
most accurate indicator of my maturity.  This includes all of my relationships but especially 
those with my family and church community.

Church life is often difficult as conflicts often erupt.  This can be an opportunity to work out 
differences and see people the way that God sees them.  Many people leave church life altogether
because of the hurt that they experience. But when they opt for this path, they curtail the 
transformation that God is trying to do within them. 

It is the friction that causes growth.  How else will we learn to forgive, serve, and love one
another?  Once people cut off communication growth stops.

Followers of Christ must be connected with others.  It is an essential part of the spiritual
life.  We must learn to communicate, forgive, and love each other through good times and bad.  Our
daily and weekly practices must include a relational inventory, where we examine honestly our
connection with others.

This is certain to be somewhat painful as we look at the dysfunctions that exists.  That is why most
people neglect to do it.  But our health depends on the ability to assess our expectations and
commitments to those closest to us.  This is a time when we need to grieve and forgive and repent
for what is broken.


## Work - Moving toward Serving

My rule of life covers what I do for work.  As a very performance-oriented person, I often am
confused about what gives my life meaning and purpose.  I mistakenly believe that my true identity
is based on my achievement.  This causes me to be overly proud of accomplishments and quite 
defensive of my failures.

A major aspect of personal transformation for me is simply understanding that work is just a part
of life, not life itself.  This requires regular attention. Daily and weekly and monthly I review
what I am working on and try to assess how this fits with my identity.

I recognize that I control myself, but can't control anyone else.  Part of my regular review 
involves asking if I am controlling what I do, say, think, and feel.  Am I controlling myself
in a way that is consistent with the destiny that God is charting for me?

I also review how effectively I am accepting that I can't control others.  I do not control what
anyone else does, says, thinks, or feels.   This is hard for me as I would like to be able
to completely control others.  My desire for influence is often related to this need to control
what others think and feel.

My growth path involves conscious relinquishing of the desire to manipulate, cajole, coerce, or
dominate others.  My daily practice is to explore those sources of greatest frustration and ask
myself where I have inappropriate expectations.  This can be extremely freeing.

Another part of my rule of life is reflecting on the roles that fulfill.  There are certain types 
of activities that are done daily that are essential to my well-being.  Some things are built
into my identity and I can't imagine life without them.

I have several recurring roles that bring fulfillment and joy.

- Write - share my ideas with other
- Teach - training others 
- Program - write software to solve problems
- Grow - learning and personal transformation

Learning my purpose and calling is a lifelong pursuit. I have come to recognize that the recurring
theme is about learning and sharing best practices.   This can be done in many different arenas. 
My joy is very tied to doing what I have been uniquely created to do.


## Rest - Moving toward Enjoyment

Over the years I have learned that life is more than just work.  My personality tends to
make me overly obsessed with my work.  To be healthy I must have interests that lie outside of 
work.  I have learned to embrace life more holistically.

Travel has always been an important part of my life.  From childhood on, I have enjoyed visiting
other places and enjoyed interacting with other cultures.  About 10% of our money and time has been
invested in some form of travel.

Dining with others is a wonderful way to interact socially with others. I enjoy smaller groups and
am often uncomfortable in larger groups. Four is the ideal number of people to share a meal. This
provides lots of opportunity to talk and listen.

Entertainment that I enjoy involves TV, movies, and books.  I read a lot of stories and it provides
a feeling that I have been allowed to experience things that I can't do in person.  I also enjoy
reading non-fiction as a leisure activity.  The act of learning something new scratches an itch for 
me.

Nature also refreshes me.  Being in the mountains or forest or looking out over a lake gives me
joy.  When the weather is good I enjoy walks in the park.

Hobbies involve mostly playing games and working on puzzles.  Most of the games I enjoy are on the
computer.

Part of my daily and weekly reflection is spent pondering how I am experiencing joy.  I look at 
my attitudes and feelings about my life.  Emotional health is very important to me and I regularly
think about how I can reduce stress and experience more joy.
