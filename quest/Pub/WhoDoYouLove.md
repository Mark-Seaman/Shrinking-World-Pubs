# Who Do You Love?

## Waves of Expanding Love

We all desire to have a need to love others. This is no accident since that desire was placed there
by God.  It is part of what brings joy into our lives. Helping others to have a better life gives
us purpose and meaning. Love does not emerge all at once but builds over time.  Let's explore how
we can have an impact on others.


## Start at Home

Love starts at home with Myself, My Family, and My People.  If I cannot love myself I can never truly
love anyone else.  As I experience the love of God personally I am able to grow in my love for
family.  

Within every family are some people that are hard to love.  This is where we learn about
unconditional love and forgiveness.  These lessons teach us valuable truths about God's love.  As
we give love to others we are also able to receive love for ourselves.

As I grow in love I begin to embrace others that I know well. These relationships add more
opportunities to share God's love with others. Small selfless acts of kindness and forgiveness help
teach us how to love better.

Say "YES” to God.  It always leads to more of everything good. Saying "NO” to myself is actually less
painful than it first appears. Learning to love is not a glorious or heroic endeavor.  Instead, it
is a simple act of humility. Start small, start now. 


## Our Community

Our journey of love begins at home but it soon spills outside of those bounds. We all live and work
and shop in a community of people. We have interactions with lots of people every day.

Even though I don't know everyone I encounter there are many people that are much like me.  They
have similar lifestyles, hopes and dreams, and fears of the future.  This is a safe place for us to
practice our growing love.

Every contact is an opportunity for encouragement.  Find ways to express God's kindness to the
people that you interact with. Stop and spend a minute with someone that you happen to meet in the
grocery store or the soccer match. 

Ask God how you can practice kindness and demonstrate his love.  You will be surprised at what
happens next.  Listen to God as you interact with others and see amazing opportunities for
meaningful connection open.  It will totally change how you see others.


## Those other people

Not everyone is like us. We often feel that those that are not like us do not really deserve love,
but the truth is that none of us really deserve God's love. We are all in need of undeserved
love.

We all have prejudices but often cannot see them.  We each hold unquestioned opinions about the worth of
others. We believe that some people are worthy and others are not. But these attitudes block God's
love in our lives and make us unable to reach out to others.

These prejudices are bone-deep and carefully guarded. We hold them to be truths that are more sacred
than the bible.

Prejudice gives us the excuse we are looking for to not love. It allows us to feel justified in not
caring. Those other people are not worthy of God's love because they are part of a despised group.
These attitudes are easy to see in others but almost impossible to see in ourselves.

I know that I need to love my neighbor. But who is my neighbor?  How far does this go? I want to
create a grouping that lets me exclude certain groups of people. And I already have strong opinions
justifying why those people do not qualify.

Any small differences can be used as a reason to not love others. While it is hard to love others
that are like us, it is almost impossible to love those that are not like us.  In fact, it is
impossible unless God is changing our hearts.

The same issue applies to every type of difference: Race, Religion, Poverty, Wealth,
Hard-working/Lazy, Underweight/Overweight, Aggressive/Shy, Sports Teams, Greeley/Ft Collins,
Education, Status, Addiction, and Politics.  Any excuse is good enough if we don't want to love in
the first place.

When we feel ourselves reacting in this way the only reasonable response is repentance. We must
confront our prejudice rather than justify it.  It is a sin that is blocking the purpose of God in
our lives and keeping us from having any influence on others.


## Our World

We cannot love the people we will never meet unless we first learn to love those we interact with
regularly.  It is impossible to feel compassion for those around the world until I am moved by a
desire to help the people I interact with daily.

World peace begins at home and grows ultimately to include everyone I am in contact with.  Only then
am I ready to play a role on a greater stage.  When I see the suffering of those around me and act
in compassion, I am compelled to do even more regularly and consistently.

Love builds from loving people I know to people everywhere that also suffer from the same things.
Politics is never the answer to all the world's problems. The practices of politics help groups make
decisions that are good for most people.  While better leaders are a good thing they really
have limited impact overall.

So where does our hope come from? Do we put our hope in politicians or national security? Without
God's love, there is no hope for the world. We have been placed here by God with the mission of being
an influence in this world (salt & light).

Effective influence is always motivated by love.  Our home, Our Community, Those Other People, and
the World.  We are called to have a maximum impact everywhere we are.  This must be rooted in
receiving God's love and spreading it to others.


## Our Task

When the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, "Lord, has the time come for you to free
Israel and restore our kingdom?” He replied, "The Father alone has the authority to set those dates
and times, and they are not for you to know. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes
upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, throughout
Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”  -- Acts 1:7-8

Being a witness means sharing truths that others need to know so that they can make effective
decisions about life. This is the process of influence.  It needs to begin at home but it
eventually needs to go everywhere.  The good news of God's redemption is the focus of the message
that we share.

It is interesting to note that the disciples were expecting a political revolution against the Roman
occupiers and Jesus never even addressed the politics of the situation.  Instead, he told them to go
be influential throughout the world completely ignoring their question.

Without receiving spiritual power from God we will never be able to accomplish the goals that we are
called to.  This process is slow and can often be hard. The most difficult part of the whole thing
is coming to grips with our own selfishness and prejudice that blocks God's love.

This is the only path to true influence.  God has given us no other option. Ultimate fulfillment and
true purpose in life will only be found by saying "YES" to this call.
