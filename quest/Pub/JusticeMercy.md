# What does God expect of his people?

The Jewish prophet Micah wrote an interesting prophesy in 700 BC.
In it he describes exactly what it would look like to follow God.  
This same message was highlighted in the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus seven 
centuries later.

God's people must demonstrate Love in Action or they are not really God's 
people at all but simply impostors that are posing as the faithful in order to
gain wealth and power.  This can be used as a litmus test since it is impossible
to fake.

**Justice, Mercy, and Humility - what God expects**

    What can we bring to the Lord?
    Should we bring him burnt offerings?
    Should we bow before God Most High
    with offerings of yearling calves?

    Should we offer him thousands of rams
    and ten thousand rivers of olive oil?
    Should we sacrifice our firstborn children
    to pay for our sins?

    No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good,
        and this is what he requires of you:
    to do what is right, to love mercy,
        and to walk humbly with your God.

    - Micah 6:8

The prophet Micah gives a message where he questions what God really wants from
his people.  He asks if God is truly interested in the outrageous sacrifices
that we are willing to give him in place of our obedience.  This message is
clear.. sacrifice from an evil heart makes God mad.

So what does he really want from us?


### Justice 

We are to do what is right, no matter the cost.  When we see injustice we are
compelled to confront it.  God is always on the side of the oppressed and
defenseless, never on the side of the oppressors.

### Mercy

Jesus exudes mercy and if we follow him them so do we. Being merciful means that
the Spirit is in control; being belligerent, critical, and judgmental means that
he is not.

### Humility

We cannot be following God and soaked in pride at the same time.  Being open to
God's leadership requires humility. This is the hallmark of people that are
truly seeking him.

These three things define what it means to follow God.  Making extraordinary
sacrifices has nothing to do with the true and honest pursuit of the King of
Kings.
