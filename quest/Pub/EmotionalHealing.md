# Emotional Healing

Core Emotions - the brain automatically triggers neurochemicals that signal strong feelings

* Joy
* Anger
* Fear
* Sadness
* Shame

The brain is four times more likely to trigger negative emotions rather than pleasure. In other
words while our brains signal both pleasure and pain. The pain sensitivity is far greater than it
is for pleasure. This explains why it is so difficult to remain happy.

Our physical bodies are looking for an excuse to trigger negative emotions. Therefore to be
emotionally healthy means to take control of our thoughts and feelings. We are responsible for the
thoughts and feelings that we entertain.

Depending on our tendency to slide into an emotional death spiral we need to engage the antidote as
quickly as we become aware of what is happening.

Each negative emotion has a solution that involves inviting God's presence into our pain. The pain we
feel is far greater and lasts far longer when we feel cut off from his presence. Therefore
gaining emotional healing is always an act of repentance.

Let's look at each of these negative emotions and see how they work. I have been learning about
this for the last few years and believe that I have stumbled on some truths that might be
helpful to you.


### Anger

The core emotion of anger is expressed in many different ways and levels of intensity... Irritation,
impatience, rage, disgust, jealousy, and hostility. The cause of anger is typically related to
being prevented from getting something that I really want.

I get angry when I don't get my way because I feel entitled. I can be angry with
myself, other people, or even God.

There can also be righteous anger but this is always in the context of someone else's suffering.
I've learned to distinguish between a true desire for justice and selfish desire to be in control and
get my own way.

Selfish anger is triggered by feeling victimized or not getting my way. My angry prayers might
look something like, "MY WILL BE DONE, IN HEAVEN AS IT IS ON EARTH". Notice the all caps.

These attitudes have a distinct lack of humility and require repentance. Next time you feel the
anger rising stop and ask yourself why. Do you feel that you are entitled to be in control? Is
the lack of control causing intense feelings? Is there a humility issue at play?


### Fear

The core emotion of fear is also expressed in many different forms, but the physical response is
measured in a spike of adrenaline and cortisol. Anxiety, nervousness, neurosis, horror, and terror
are all examples of this lovely emotion.

It is possible to be completely controlled by our fears. This is the worst kind of slavery
imaginable. A person controlled by fear has lost faith, in themselves, in others, in the world,
and even in God.

They believe that fresh tragedy is waiting around every corner. The answer to fear is a renewal of
faith. Reading scripture and rehearsing stories of how God saved me in the past is a great way to
allow me to see through the lens of faith.


### Sadness

The core emotion of sadness is also expressed in many different forms... depression, despair, grief,
resignation, and self-pity. All of these emotions are so powerful that they can completely
dominate our life, leaving no room for anything else.

As we experience loss, we can lose hope for the future. It becomes difficult, maybe even impossible,
for us to imagine a good life at any time in the future. Our thoughts grow dark and we become
obsessed with all that we have lost.

In these times, we must welcome God's presence into our lives. Only God can give us the hope that
we need.


### Shame

Shame is the feeling that we are not good enough and will never be. This feeling isolates us
emotionally from all other people, from ourselves, and even from God. Shame is a killer of
relationships. It can lead us to sabotage our connections with others and withdraw from all human
contact.

We feel shame when we are not giving and receiving love. Humans require love in order to even
survive. When we are feeling rejected, ostracized, shunned, and banished from healthy interaction
we need to feel love. This is the only true remedy for shame.

We need to both give and receive love in order to be restored to health. When we feel shame, doing
something kind can be a great way to experience love. This simple act can turn around what we feel.
Giving love may make us feel more able to receive it as well.


### Dealing with Pain

Each form of pain has its own solution. Each disease has an antidote.  As you suffer through
different types of problems become aware of the pain you are feeling. Look to God for the
corresponding solution that matches what you are currently dealing with.  Each problem has a 
matching solution.

* Anger - Humility
* Fear - Faith
* Sadness - Hope
* Shame - Love

It is tempting to medicate our pain. While this does offer some measure of short-term relief it can
create far larger problems in the future. We all have our favorite ways to self-medicate, but be
warned "There be Dragons Here".

Seeking God's presence in our pain can produce true solutions with no downside. It is what I call
a "Win/Win/Win/Win". Lean into Humility, Faith, Hope, Love. Whatever you need most is what you
should pursue desperately with God.
