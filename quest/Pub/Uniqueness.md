# Embracing Uniqueness

We have a fundamental assumption that conformity is good - unusual is bad. But I
will thrive only by embracing my unique opportunity and challenges. I cannot
live someone else's life; I must live my own. My brain functions differently
than most people. This is both good and bad news. My people are defined by
shared life experiences and similar patterns of thought,  motivation,
relationship dynamics, and behavior. 

Some people have a high value for conformity and naturally fit in to whatever
group they find themselves in.  This has never been my experience.  Conformity has 
always been an anti-value for me, rather than something to be sought.  I value
the conflict of ideas to forge a better world and often side with the rebels
against authority when coerced.

If the crowd goes one way I am inclined to go the other. Swimming upstream is
a fundamental part of my nature and identity.  Of course this has a serious
downside. Being independent means I often stand alone.  But I now understand
this to be a biological tendency rather than a simple behavioral problem.

One of great ironies for me is to find other people who think and feel the
same way I do about conformity and independence.  The people that would identify
themselves as autistic typically have a life story about social conformity
very similar to my own.  I have always resonated with the idea of a different
drummer.


## Ability and Disability

People like me have both extra capability that most do not possess and
disabilities that must be overcome. Psychologists would classify us as autistic,
but labels are used often to devalue the members of a minority group.  I identify
with the thinking patterns, motivations, and social patterns that psychologists
would call autistic.

But beyond the pathology there is a simple truth of being unique and
non-typical. I do not see myself as pathological or mentally ill, although I do
have a fair amount of dysfunction in my thinking and acting. I am not typical
... I am both better and worse that others.   I am more "neuro-divergent" than
defective.

I am on the autistic spectrum, so this means that I must learn how to limit
my blind spots while pursuing my strengths.  The wonderful thing for me is too
discover that I am not alone.  There are a lot of others who experience life
in a very similar way.  These are my people.


## Extraordinary intellectual and creative capabilities

Meyers Briggs define a spectrum of Intuitive - Sensing (N vs S).
I peg the scale on N.  I am easily overwhelmed by sensory input.  Being in a
noisy restaurant with lots of people pushes my panic button.  On the other 
hand I can spend hours in Mind-Meld with my computer.

Deep focus for long hours is no problem but conversation drains me of energy 
in a few minutes. Creative insights and breakthrough ideas come easily.  I 
regularly start my day with a brainstorm of 30 ideas I wish to pursue.

Connect with other autistic people love the high energy exchange of ideas. I am
prone to independent thinking and often rebel against the pressure to  conform.
I have little need for validation from those in authority but crave the approval
of other creative types. 

I am energized by the search for truth and deeper understanding.  I often build
relationships with others who are idea people and we can talk for hours about
many topics.  I find those that are not interested in ideas boring and judge them
to be shallow.

I often have conflict with S-types because I live in a virtual world and they 
live in a physical world.  My perfect day is about 10 hours of creative work and
1 hour of deep conversation.


## Extraordinary disabilities

For neuro-typical people, there is great joy in normal human interaction. I have
learned over the years, that it is very difficult to understand what others
are thinking.  Other humans are opaque to me and I seldom know what they are 
feeling or why.

Most people have a natural empathy that allows them to walk into a room and know
within seconds what everyone is feeling.  My wife is a superb empath and is 
always aware.

I blunder into every conversation and am naturally blind to most social queues.
I wait for my wife to give me the elbow when I say something inappropriate.
When she's not with me I'm a bull in a china shop.

This causes a great deal of alienation with others.  I have learned to keep my
mouth shut most of the time.  When I do disclose how I feel it often results in
over-sharing and a deep sense of shame that I could not hold back.

This makes it very difficult to truly trust other and results in them not being
able to trust me.  I have a handful of deep friendships but little desire to
invest in casual acquaintances.


## Controlling What I Say

I must be very careful in everything I say.  It requires constant vigilance to
avoid offending others and communicating things that damage rapport. Because I
don't understand the constant negotiation of power and position and status I
naturally don't value it.  This places me in constant peril of saying something
that I shouldn't.

Most people naturally edit their thoughts before they are shared.  My brain does
not have this natural process at work.  For me it is a task requiring enormous
intellectual effort to edit my thoughts so that they are acceptable to others. 
People often say that to get along you just need to be yourself.   For me this
is a recipe for disaster. 

"Be yourself", is common advise given to create meaningful interactions between
two people. This is the opposite of how I must interact with others.  In my family
of origin, it was considered honest to openly communicate each thought that
popped into your head.  

"Wow, you've put on a lot of weight recently" or "Your shirt is really ugly", 
were considered just stating the obvious truth.  My wife needed to train me
that this kind of communication was hurtful and out-of-bounds.

I'll never forget being at church and commenting on how ugly a new-born baby was.
I was surprised to be rebuked because I assumed that the parents were aware that
their baby was homelier than typical.  I have no natural filter, so must work
hard to consciously edit me communication.


## Connecting with People

Important conversations for me are impossible without an enormous amount of
work.  Without this I blunder in and make the situation far worse than avoiding
it altogether.  Any conversation involving potential conflict requires hours 
of careful planning.  

* What to say
* What to avoid
* Land mines
* Framing
* Common ground
* Humility
* Acceptance
* Affirmation
* What we agree to

After the encounter, there may be several more hours of post-game review and
critique. This makes my engagement with others extremely draining.  If it goes
well then I feel good.  When it goes bad it feels like a catastrophe.

If I take this difficult path to control the conversation, then the outcome is
good about 80% of the time.  When I do not put in the effort then 25% of the time
I have a good outcome (leaving a 75% change of disaster).


## The Chosen Few

There is no easy or natural way for me to relate with others.  I have grown to
accept this and recognize that I was born this way.  Therefore, I am very frugal
with how I invest in my relationships.  Some people are very important to me
and I interact with a great deal of care and conscious thought.

In order to make this work I must consciously avoid more casual relationships. I
realize that I have a shallow capacity to relate and prioritize the few over the
many.  This means that I am always asking, "Can I build deep trust?" or "Will
this person be a lifelong friend?".  If not then they go into the acquaintance
bucket and get little mindshare.

I know this sounds weird, but it is only way I can address my social disability.
Spending too much energy on casual acquaintances leaves me depleted.  That is
when my disability turns to dysfunction.
