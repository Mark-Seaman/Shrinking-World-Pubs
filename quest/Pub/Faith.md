Understanding religion and spirituality


## Private Expression of Faith


Let's explore the dynamics and practicality of following God.  Faith in God is
expressed in two basic ways.  There is the private life that we have as we seek
to follow God.  This private expression of faith guides our actions when no one
else sees us.   We all have a  personal experience and secret history with God. 


A private spirituality is where we meet Jesus on an emotional level.  If we do
not connect emotionally then our relationship with God will be shallow and
impossible to sustain.   Our pursuit of spiritual things will be lifeless until
we experience a mystical encounter with the living God.

Every human has a primal desire for the supernatural and to touch eternity.  We
may experience this as part of corporate worship but these ecstatic experiences
are always deeply personal and private.  This personal encounter with God stands
in deep contrast to the institutional and organizational faith that captures so
much of our attention.

Spirituality operates at the emotional level rather than the intellectual one. In fact, our
spiritual experience is often offensive to our minds.  It requires us to listen instead to our
hearts. I find that my heart and head often are opposing each other for my allegiance.

The mind is typically controlled by ego and naturally against the things of the
Spirit of God.  I believe the journey of transformation occurs in the emotions
and then flows to the understanding as an outcome.  The primary battleground of
faith is therefore the heart, not the head.

### Aspects of spirituality


There are several aspects of our personal experience of God.  True spirituality
addresses many different issues in our lives. Without covering all of these, our
spirituality remains shallow and undeveloped.  When spirituality is lacking
religion naturally fills the gap.  In other words, when we have no real
experience of God, our lives are filled concepts about God.  The mind takes the
lead when the heart is unwilling to.

## Public Expression of Faith


Some people believe that faith is only a private matter, just between me and
God.  The bible teaches us that our faith is not real unless it changes our
relationships with others.  How we interact with others both demonstrates and
develops our spiritual transformation.  True faith must have both a private and
a public expression.

The fruit of the Spirit (Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness,
Faithfulness, Gentleness, Self-control) are certainly personal characteristics,
but they are demonstrated in relationships.  God has placed us in relationships
for the purpose of walking out our faith with others.

Family and church form the core relationships for followers of Christ.  Every
other relationship flows from these.  Family would include blood relatives but
also those people that I intend to spend the rest of my life with.  True family
relationships may form with those beyond my to include those that I have a deep
commitment to.  These people are a part of my life story for better or worse
over the long-run.

Church relationships involve people that God has put in my life to help me
discover his plan and purpose.  These people may be scattered across the globe
and may be in my life for just a time.  Many of my church relationships may not
attend the same church organization to which I belong.  It is important to have
deep church relationships with people that think very different from me.

Deep relationships cannot form without spending time together.  Belonging to the
same church for a very long does not make people close.  Interacting in
meaningful ways is what makes people close.  The most accurate metric to measure
closeness in church relationships is how many minutes have I spent with someone
in deep conversation of personal matters over the last year.

Most people that I know are satisfied with shallow relationships, and are
unwilling to devote the time required to move beyond that.  I have had very few
meaningful conversations  with church people.  Others often seem too busy with
their own lives to allow access to others.  This leads me to wonder if it is
even possible to have meaningful relationships in the church.  Our very notions
of church seem to go against true and deep personal connection.
