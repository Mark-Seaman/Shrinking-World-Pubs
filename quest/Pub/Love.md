# Meaningful Relationships

Relationships are complex and often difficult.  But connecting with others is perhaps the deepest
and most rewarding task that we will be involved with. Fulfillment in life can only come when we
have meaningful relationships with others.

Social health is a direct result of emotional health and cannot exist without it. Therefore, EQ
(emotional intelligence) is a prerequisite for good relationships.  Remaining immature will
undermine our relationships and put a limit on the meaningful connections that we have with
others.


## What is Love?

Creating meaningful relationships can be tricky.  But it is worth it. Humans crave interaction with
others so much that without it you will wither and die. Solitary confinement is one of the worst of
all punishments and threatens your mental health and sanity.

Even introverts require meaningful relationships to truly thrive.  Extroverts know that social
interaction is important since they get energy from being around others.  Introverts require more
time to recharge after social activities, but all of us need meaningful contact to thrive. Quality
relationships are not easy and take work for all people.

It is the depth (not breadth) of relationships that brings happiness and fulfillment. Often it is
better to have fewer friends that you enjoy deeper interactions with than a large number of casual
acquaintances.

Happiness is related to the depth of your relationships as well as how often you are able to get
together. We all have friends that we have lost touch with.  It might be a good idea to renew those
connections.

Four factors are key to every relationship:

* Trust
* Compassion
* Empathy
* Influence

Each of these factors is reciprocal.  In other words, your feelings are very likely to mirror
their feeling toward you. For example, if you do not have compassion or trust for Bob then you
cannot expect Bob to feel compassion or trust toward you.

Let's look at each of the four factors and do a relational inventory.


## Trust

Trust is simply the confidence that you have in another person.  It also is the measure of the
confidence that they have in you.  Each interaction that you have affects this confidence.   It is
far easier to damage trust than it is to build it.

The circuitry in the amygdala (the part of the brain that controls emotions) is skewed toward pain
and away from pleasure.  You are biologically capable of signaling joy, anger, fear, sadness, and
shame.  These are automatically triggered involuntary responses.

Note that four of the five signals tell you of danger.  It is no wonder that we find it so hard to
trust.  Our response to threat is far more sensitive than the joy response. This means that 4 of 5
interactions will be negative.

We said that trust is confidence in another person.  But confidence in what exactly?

* Capability - Can this person do what they say they can do?
* Character - What kind of a person am I dealing with? Will they lie, cheat, and steal?
* Compassion - Do they truly care for me or will they hurt me when it benefits them?

If one element is missing then you can seek to build confidence in that area. But if two or more are
lacking then your job will be extremely difficult.  If you can not trust someone then your
relationship will be superficial at best. At worst you should actively seek to distance yourself
from them.

Seek to build depth or cut your losses.  Remember that only high-quality relationships will bring
you happiness.


## Compassion

Everyone is naturally inclined to meet their own needs.   Self-interest is a powerful incentive for
us humans.  Some people never get beyond that.  They always see the world through the lens of their
own interests, desires, and needs.

A lack of compassion drives us to love things and use people when we ought to love people and use
things. Compassion is the ability to put the other person's needs in front of our own.  This allows
us to look to the interests of others and not just please ourselves.

Without compassion, we may seek to benefit others only when we receive all of the glory for the act.
We have all known people that like to appear generous while only serving their own egos.  If we are
truly honest we all have a certain amount of this attitude.  We must actively seek to replace this
with true compassion.

A kind act done in secret is more likely to be truly motivated by compassion. As compassion becomes
our default attitude we become people of easy generosity and openness toward others.


## Empathy

An essential aspect of any relationship is knowing what the other person is feeling. This requires an
awareness of our own emotional state and the maturity to manage our feelings. Without this maturity,
it will be very difficult to ignore our own feeling long enough to appreciate those of another.

Empathy happens when we join with the emotional experience of another human being. It is what allows
us to feel what they feel and see things from their unique perspective. Because we are emotional
beings we make decisions primarily based on our emotions and then apply our rational logic to
justify our actions.

We like to think that we are rational beings with emotions, but the truth is that we are emotional
beings who rationalize. Without being able to understand the feeling of someone you can never truly
understand the choices that they make.  Empathy is the key component of understanding.

There is circuitry in the brain that is highly attuned to facial expressions and tone of voice. A
lot of neurons are dedicated to the task of understanding the feelings of others.  In some people this
is underdeveloped. Autistic people can't read the
feelings of others. 

This is an area where I struggle to get to a level that comes so naturally for others. My brain just
doesn't easily perceive the emotions of others. I often plow ahead when others would see the
signs that a retreat is called for. This insensitivity is never intentional, but I fail to see what
other people do. 

I find it hard to read others and know what they are feeling. Over the years I have learned coping
mechanisms that help me compensate for this clear weakness. But it takes self-awareness and a lot
of mental energy. This is the main reason that social interactions are so taxing for me.


## Influence

In great relationships, people rub off on each other.  Both parties are mutually influenced to be
better people.  In horrible relationships the opposite is true. Both people influence one another
to move toward the dark side.  Whether for good or ill people will influence one another.

This is a highly desirable outcome within all relationships. You should want to have a positive 
influence on others. We must be careful to recognize that we do not
control others.  We cannot control what anyone else thinks, feels, says, or does.  Each person is
responsible for their own decisions.

Our influence comes from the example of how we live life.  If we live well then others will wish to
emulate us, if not then they will seek the opposite.  The only true power that we have over others
is the ability to inspire and encourage.

There is no influence without trust, compassion, and empathy. To the extent that you master these,
you will have influence.  Positional power has little to do with influence. Never mistake these
two.  Many people have positional authority but no real influence.  There are also many that
have real influence despite the lack of position.

As you regularly inspire and encourage others it may grow into a formal mentoring relationship. This
can't be forced because you need to develop the areas of trust, compassion, and empathy.  This 
takes time and interactions.  It must form naturally over time.

Openness to new ideas and 
vulnerability result as relationships develop. This is a characteristic of true influence and can't 
be rushed.  There is no shortcut to deep trust. 

Every human must have a least one very deep relationship.  This is the person you would call upon
when disaster strikes your life.   If you can't identify them easily then this is your top priority.
You need to have someone that you trust explicitly with your life.

We also need several other meaningful relationships.  The number doesn't need to be large but we need
several others with whom we can discuss difficult things.
