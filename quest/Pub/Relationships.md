# Nurturing Relationships

## Give and Receive

Part of my spiritual life involves how I connect with others.  This requires having both serving
relationships and nurturing ones.  Serving others is an essential part of following Christ. Without
it, we believe that our lives are about personal fulfillment.  Serving others is where we die to
ourselves and lay down our egos.

Relationships that nurture us are essential and how we receive from others.  Without them, we never
fully embrace the process of transformation that God is inviting us into.  When we give to others
we must expect nothing in return.  But we also need to interact with others in a mutual exchange of
giving and receiving love and encouragement. 

Other people are also vital to see what we cannot and hold us accountable.  We must have people that
will carry us when we are weak and those we trust enough to be vulnerable with.  I believe that
these relationships are experienced in three primary roles: Teacher, Student, and Peer.  In each role,
we learn to both give and receive.


## Nurturing Roles

Finishing well requires that we live our lives sustainably.  Without nurturing relationships we run
dry and will leave the race eventually.  We must work now to build friendships that will carry us
through the hard times. These relationships must be cultivated during the calm times in life or
they will not be available when we need them most.

As a teacher, we seek to pour our life into others and desire to form a mutual bond of trust and
commitment to each other.  It is not about imparting knowledge but rather an understanding of life
itself.  This requires vulnerability on both the part of the teacher and the student.

As a student, we seek to absorb and be formed by the experience of another.  We discuss our ideas
and also our struggles, hoping for a deeper level of understanding.  We learn to listen from those
that are further along the path.   We apply the wisdom that they offer us to our daily
experiences.

As a peer, we often play the role of both teacher and student, without one predominating.  There is
no job description for these roles and people can move into new roles as relationships develop. But
I find it helpful to clarify the nature of the interactions because it allows me to think about
what is missing.


## Personal Assessment

I find that my relationships are dominated by serving others.  Within this realm, I work hard to
avoid expectations of personal benefit. I attempt to invest my time, energy, and money in other
people, hoping to enrich them.  Removing expectations for reciprocity lets me be content
with the interactions as they are rather than as I wish them to be.

The relationships that nurture me are quite different.  My goal is to invest in the relationship,
expecting to build mutual trust and respect.  I am called to serve those that I do not respect, but
to be nurtured by another requires trust.  I have expectations of growing more trust over time and
will only engage with others that share my commitment.

Over the last few years, I have thought a great deal about the nature of these relationships and
have found that I have been greatly lacking.  Recently I have been blessed to connect with a couple
of people that I can learn from and am benefiting greatly from the interaction.  I now also have
become a mentor for others that are behind me in the journey.


## Mind the Gap

The area where I still feel a great need is to have peers that I can share my life with.   I would
like to develop new friendships with others that are at a similar stage of life.  Together we would
be able to discuss the challenges of daily living and simply walk through life's experiences.  My
goal is to develop life-long friends and enjoy the rapport we develop.

Most serious disciples that I know have a deficit of life-giving relationships and are in danger of
burning out for this reason. It is necessary for people who spend their lives giving to others to
have relationships where they also receive. I am looking for others who might resonate with this
idea.  I have no expectations for what this might look like but rather a personal need I am looking
to satisfy.
