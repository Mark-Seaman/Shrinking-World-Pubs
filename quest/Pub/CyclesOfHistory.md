# The Cycles of History

## Crisis of the Century

We have been through other crises but this time is unique.  America has weathered some serious
storms over the centuries.  These include full-scale revolution, civil war, multiple world wars,
economic collapse, pandemic, and famine.

About every generation experiences a time of reckoning that could be seen as a wake-up call.  During
this time of crisis, we reevaluate what it means to be an American.  The last such event was 9-11. 

Traumatic events affect everyone in society. But how we experience the event depends on our life
stage and circumstances.  Each generation will see events differently and assign different types of
lessons based on their age.  For example, children and grandparents may live through a war but the
impact is very unique for each of them.


## Minor and Major Catastrophes 

During our lifetime we will expect to experience four of these minor crisis points.  Each of them
will leave an imprint based on the lessons that we learn and the meaning we assign. Generations are
aligned in their thinking based on the events and the life stage in which they were experienced.

But there is a much larger cycle of history that also has a profound influence on our nation and the
world as a whole. As we look back over the last 300 years we see periods of time where the crisis
transforms us at a fundamental level.  During these times our very existence is threatened.  These
periods of upheaval are so great that they alter how we live for the next
century.

Every eighty years we look into the abyss.  We envision the peril and we move to do what must be
done.   There simply is no alternative to success.  Our very survival hangs in the balance.  We
must build a new world.  The old structures and systems are no longer working for us.


## New World Order

These dates define a turning point, with a BEFORE and AFTER. The way we live is altered - there is
no turning back.  We make new decisions about how we will live going forward.  The way we lived
before is no longer acceptable.

These dates are just trigger points that signal a long period of change. They are simply the trigger
for a transition that may occur over many years.  Currently, we find ourselves caught in a season
of profound turmoil.  We will get through it but there is no going back.  The only way forward
is through.


## Facing the Current Challenges

We are facing a cataclysmic meltdown in many of the institutions that directly affect our lives.  We
are at a historic inflection point - a hinge point in our national story.  Every institution and
practice must be reinvented to better fit the demand of the new world.

The crisis of our time is severe and will force us to adapt.  The hope is that after we
adapt, the world will be far better than the old one we left behind.  I believe in the American
spirit and fully trust that we will innovate through the crisis. The next five years will be quite
bumpy but I am confident that we will get through it.

I also believe in the basic goodness of our people.  As events have unfolded this has often been
hidden from view.  We have allowed the loudest and most brutal people to rise to the top.  Now is
the time to listen to the leaders that will take us through the transformation that is so badly
needed. We must and we will rally to meet the challenges that face us.

In order to succeed we must ...

- act together
- act holistically
- act now
- act redemptively

I know we will do what is required.
