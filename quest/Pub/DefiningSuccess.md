# Defining Success

The concept of success is highly personal and subjective, and can vary greatly from person to
person. For some individuals, success may be defined as achieving a certain level of financial or
career success, while for others it may be about personal growth, fulfilling relationships, or
making a positive impact in the world.

However, one thing that is true for everyone is that our values play a significant role in shaping
our feelings of success. When we define success in a way that is aligned with our values, we are
more likely to feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction when we achieve our goals.

So, what are values, exactly? In simplest terms, values are the things that we believe are important
in life. They can be abstract concepts like honesty, compassion, or freedom, or more concrete
things like family, career, or health.

Our values are deeply ingrained within us and often develop over the course of our lives through our
experiences, relationships, and cultural influences. They are what guide our decisions, shape our
attitudes, and influence our behaviors.

When it comes to defining success, our values are a crucial factor to consider. If we define success
solely based on external factors such as money, power, or status, we may find that achieving these
goals doesn't bring us the fulfillment or satisfaction we expected. On the other hand, if we
measure success by personal growth, meaningful relationships, and pursuing our passions, we may
find that we experience more lasting happiness.

To understand this more fully, let's take a look at some common values and how they might shape our
definition of success.

## Career Success:

For many people, their career is a significant part of their identity and plays a major role in how
they define success. However, the definition of career success can vary widely depending on an
individual's values.

For example, if you value financial security, you may feel successful when you achieve a certain
level of income or when you have a stable job with good benefits. On the other hand, if you value
creative expression, you may feel successful when you complete a project that showcases your
talents or when you have the freedom to work on projects that inspire you.

## Relationships:

Relationships are another important area where values can shape our feelings of success. For some
people, success in relationships may mean finding a romantic partner and building a long-term
commitment together. For others, success in relationships may mean developing deep and meaningful
connections with family and friends.

If you value emotional intimacy and connection, you may feel successful when you have close,
supportive relationships with others. If you value independence and autonomy, you may feel
successful when you have the freedom to pursue your interests and passions without feeling tied
down by others.

## Personal Growth:

Personal growth is another area where values can play a significant role in shaping our definition
of success. For some individuals, success in this area may mean challenging themselves to learn new
things, take on new challenges, or overcome personal obstacles.

If you value personal growth and development, you may feel successful when you have learned a new
skill or when you have overcome a significant challenge. On the other hand, if you value stability
and consistency, you may feel successful when you have achieved a sense of routine and
predictability in your life.

## Making a Positive Impact:

For some individuals, success may be defined by the impact they make in the world. If you value
making a positive impact, you may feel successful when you contribute to a cause that you care
about or when you help others in need.

Whether you define success in terms of career, relationships, personal growth, or making a positive
impact, the key is to ensure that your goals and values are aligned. When we define success in a
way that is aligned with our values we greatly improve our personal happiness.
