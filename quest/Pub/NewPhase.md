# New Phase of Life

## Need to Know

Finding meaningful work is a key part of our happiness in life.  It is hard to
be content while not having fulfilling work.   I have a deep urge to fully
understand the dynamics of my work life in order to find fulfillment.   

My focus has shifted from pursuing success to pursuing meaning. I've always been
interested in learning more about the world. But in the last few years, this has
become my primary passion.  When I was younger understanding seemed like a
luxury that I could not afford to invest in.  My time and energy were consumed
trying to make a living and grow a family.

As the need to generate income and the demands of family life have subsided, I
have found new freedom to renew interests that have been placed on hold. 
History, economics, psychology, geology, anthropology, religion, and cultures
have taken center stage.  I now consider my primary job to be seeking
enlightenment.

The job of "Wise Man" or "Guru" does not pay well, but I am willing to invest my
best efforts in this arena.  Because I am naturally very performance-oriented,
I plan on producing a series of books to document what I find.  My ambitious
goal is to write a book that captures my life philosophy.  This is intended to
provide focus to my personal quest.


## Curiosity

By nature, I am both curious and creative.  I live in a world of ideas and have some difficulty
being anchored in the physical reality.  I often have 100 questions rolling through my mind about
weather patterns, plate tectonics, oceanography, wildlife, and history.  I should spend
more time outdoors to learn to enjoy nature.

The Meyers-Briggs personality profile defines a spectrum of preferences from Sensing(physical world)
to Intuitive (virtual world).   I peg this scale.  My perfect world would be a completely virtual
reality in which our minds could be used to their limits and we could live, work, and love without
the annoyance of pain, sickness, and death.  Alas, this is never to be.

As an idealist, I see the way that things should be in their ideal state.  Sadly real life is never
ideal and most of my energy is focused on accepting the disappointing reality of what is. I try to
see the silver lining but the storm clouds make it hard for me.  I struggle with the way things are
and constantly wonder why no one else sees it the way I do.

My natural curiosity has me looking for why things are a certain way and my engineering mindset
leads me toward creative problem-solving.  I want to change the world and am frustrated by the way
it is. 


## Naturally Limited

My quest for understanding is rooted in trying to figure out how to thrive in a world filled with
physical reality.  Much of this quest for me has been coming to grips with the extremely limited
impact that I can have on the world around me.  When I was younger I always believed that I could
make the world better, but as I grow old, view this as a rather naive notion. I now view my
contribution to the world as extremely limited.  This has given me a new humility.  I see that
while I can do some things there is much that is out of reach.

With my limited amount of energy and resources, I try to focus on the areas where I can have the
most impact.  These are inevitably the arenas where my special gifting can be used.  The farther
I get from my superpowers the less effective I am and the more frustration I experience.

I try to limit my concerns to areas that I control.  Since all I control is what I do, say, think,
or feel, I try to limit my concern to only those areas. Everything else requires me to simply
accept reality as it is.  This is easier said than done for someone that has ideas and opinions
about everything.


## Product over People

Every business is built on two concepts:  producing value and selling.  I believe that this is also
true of individuals.   Contributing value hinges on our abilities to produce creative output
(production), and convince others that this product should be used (marketing).  I've been involved
with both of these issues in every career and endeavor:  Writing, Teaching, Engineering, Business,
Pastoring, and even Parenting.

If I grade my lifetime performance I would get an "A+" for production, and "F" for marketing. All
of my happy moments are related to producing extraordinary creative output. All of my darkest
moments have been tied to my failures in marketing.  I have learned that here lies the path to
misery and despair.

My capacity to solve problems is limited to issues that do not involve humans. I have been extremely
successful at designing, extending, and troubleshooting complex mechanical and computer systems but
find earthlings beyond understanding.  My years as business owner were the most miserable
of my entire career because 80-90% of my energy went into marketing.  When given a project, I
could deliver, but I could never connect with others enough to gain the business.


## Understanding My Career

This one area of understanding has been freeing to me.  I no longer seek to sell and will avoid any
opportunity that hinges on my sales ability.  Instead, I actively look for opportunities to learn
and share best practices.  This work always involves a deep understanding of the way things work
and mastery of the basic concepts that will improve how things can be done.  This has become my
life passion.

This has been developed in several different areas in recent years:  Writing, Teaching, Software
Engineering, Web Development, and even Parenting.  I find that each of these allows a unique
form of self-expression and sharing ideas with others.  I cannot imagine giving up any of these
pursuits to follow the others.  Each offers me a distinct kind of joy.

Capitalism runs on the idea of supply and demand.  This maps onto the twin objectives of production
and marketing.  In our society marketing is valued far more than production.  The split appears to
be around 70/30 and may be closer to 80/20.  When a tech guy and business person start a technology
company the perceived value of the technical contribution is typically 10-20%.

This is quite bad news for someone who excels with tech more than people.  This is what led me to
read a mountain of self-help books on how to sell and schmooze.  I thought that I could learn
skills without any innate talent.  I finally awoke to the truth about myself and admitted that I
will never find joy in anything requiring sales.  My path to glory lies in production.


## Economic Reality

Capitalism demands that we generate demand for what we supply.  Fortunately, most of my career was
spent working for HP.  It was easy for me to keep my bosses happy by doing great technical work.
This allowed me to concentrate on solving engineering problems and leave business problems to
others.  This was close to a perfect fit for me and gave me much joy and good monetary rewards. For
26 years I was well paid.

That all ended when I left HP.  After starting Shrinking World Solutions I continued to grow
professionally and my production capacity doubled and eventually quadrupled.  At the same time, my
job satisfaction plummeted along with my income.  After 10 years the business was dead and my
self-esteem had taken a beating.  I calculate that my effort had increased by 50% while my income
had dropped by 50%, when compared to my time at HP.

Fortunately, I started saving at age 23.  I stopped saving at age 45 after only 22 years.  By age 55
we were able to begin living on our retirement savings. This would never have been possible if I
would have had a more typical job.  We would have not survived the business years if we needed to
make a full income in the time after HP.

Our economic situation allowed us to adopt the following profile that led me to choose my work
without regard to getting paid.

- Save - age 23-45
- Hold - age 45-55
- Spend - age 55-62


## Contribution Reality

What would you do with your life if money were not the driving issue?  Most of my career choices
have been defined by the reality of economics and the need to make a living.  This is no longer the
case as long as our investments hold out. Now I have the luxury of choosing the type of work that I
want to do.  

My work is determined by what I value the most.  Here are the things that I
value in my work life.

1. Autonomy - freedom to choose who, what, when, where, how, why
2. Mastery - move toward perfection, content with current reality
3. Purpose - make a difference for others
4. Creativity - build something from my imagination
5. Variety - exposure to new ideas and experiences
6. Influence - share my ideas with others

This is a complex set of values that I seek to satisfy in my work life.  Fortunately, I have a number of roles that fulfill all of these objectives.


## Job Opportunities

**Author**  - As a writer, I have lots of freedom to develop and share my ideas
with others.  I experience a great deal of joy in writing and intend  to do it
for the rest of my life.  My life as an author is not encumbered by the need to
make money.  This pursues me to select projects that are of interest to me and
not worry about whether or not it is of interest to others.

**Inventor** - I am a compulsive software developer.  It brings me great joy to
write code.  This is an act of world-building that is one of my life's greatest
thrills.  When I worked for others I longed to pursue my own ideas and projects.
 Now I have the freedom to do that.

**Teacher** - There are two things I enjoy about teaching college: building
course content and interacting with students.  Course building combines all of
the elements of Author, Inventor, and Teacher.  I am challenged by the act of
learning and sharing best practices.  I am thrilled to create courses that are
taught at the university.  I also enjoy the actual teaching and the opportunity
to interact with students.

Freedom from economics is the key to finding happiness in my work life.  If I
were forced to make a living then most of the joy would be sacrificed as a
result.  This represents the ideal retirement for me.  If I have to make money
then I have to work on the goals that others value; if I don't then I can
work on my own goals.

I am experiencing more joy now in my work than I ever have before.  I hope that
I can continue along this path.
