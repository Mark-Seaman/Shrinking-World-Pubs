# Spiritual Fruit

The Spirit of God produces fruit in our lives.   The amount of fruitfulness that we experience is
directly related to how much we yield ourselves to the will of God. None of us do this completely,
just as no one is pure evil.  All humans remain a complex mix of motivations, spirituality, and
depravity.

It is the presence of the Spirit in our lives that changes us.  This is a sovereign act of God 
releasing his power in our lives.  It also is a process that requires our participation.  We can
thwart God's desire to bring us to maturity by actively resisting his will.

As we yield to God there is a supernatural and natural process that takes place.   Fruit is the
result of health.  No plant strains to produce fruit.  It just happens when the plant is healthy.


## Emotional Health

The primary characteristic of spiritual health is emotional health.  I know many people that claim
to be spiritual and yet remain grossly immature emotionally.  Their lives are dominated by runaway
emotions: Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Shame.

Spiritual fruit moves us toward the character of Christ.  Our experience of love reduces our sense
of shame.  Joy heals our sadness and peace replaces fear.  Much of our anger is resolved as we 
grow in humility.

The spiritual transformation that takes place can be quite profound. Producing fruit reduces the
emotional pain in our lives.  Without this maturity, we can remain toddlers forever.  Youth is 
fleeting but immaturity can last a lifetime.

The choice comes down to a stark selection.

- My will or God's will 
- Pain or Fruit 
- Darkness or Light

## Social Health

Relationships are a good measure of maturity.  Without our character being developed our relations
with others will be a disaster.  Transformation is required in order to have good interactions
with people.

Social fruit will make us more patient, kind, and gentle.  Without this will become increasingly
demanding, cruel, and aggressive toward others.

Meaningful relationships require humility.  This is needed if we are to treat others with respect.
Prideful people live in a perpetual state of anger and rage is easily triggered.

Who am I when no one sees?  How do I treat others the weak and helpless?  This is the true measure
of social fruit in my life.

## Motivational Health

Motivation determines behavior.   What we do is a direct result of what drives us.   When our
motivation is corrupt, evil deeds will soon follow.

Producing motivational fruit leads us to be good, faithful, and controlled.  Without being
transformed at the deepest level we become even more selfish, corrupt, and lawless.  

We push the boundaries and seek only to avoid the punishment that results from getting caught.
People that are overly sensitive about accountability, usually have a darkness within that drives
them.
