# Transformation

## Spiritual Transformation

Jesus told a story about a son that demanded his inheritance.  After a brief time, he squandered the
money and found himself starving. The son's problems were clearly self-inflicted.

In that moment of clarity, he determined to admit his fault and maybe get a job working as a servant
for the father he had scorned.  In the story, the father reinstated the son, with great
extravagance, and threw a great party.

This story can teach us about the process of spiritual transformation.  There were a series of
things that can happen along the path to restoration.

- Fed up - We must get tired of our life as we know it.
- Own up - We must admit that we have made a mess.
- Hands up - We must surrender and ultimately lift our hands to receive all that God has for us.

Our posture changes from a closed fist to open hands ready to be embraced by our father.

This change in attitude is not a one-time event but rather a precious moment that will recur with
greater frequency throughout our lifetime.  The first time may be dramatic because it takes so much
to get to the initial turning point.

As we become more familiar with the process, we become more sensitive to the call of the Spirit
toward restoration and redemption.  It becomes easier to yield to God's fantastic love.

Take an hour or so to think about your own journey.

- Are you longing for transformation or want to continue controlling your own life?
- Do you have enough courage to admit that you have messed things up and need help?
- Are you ready to open your clenched fist to receive what God has for you with open
  hands?

If so you are on the right road to peace with God.


## Vocational Transformation

Do you love your work?

So much time is spent at work that how we feel about work colors our perception about everything
else that we experience in life.  Most of us spend about half of our waking hours thinking about
work.

An important transformation is needed in our work life. We need to see work less as a means to some
end, but more as an end in itself. God has placed you in a specific situation for a purpose.

Sometimes we fully grasp this purpose and at other times we are completely unaware of why we are in
this job at all.  If we do not feel that we are where God wants us to be then we need to leave and
find the place where we ought to be.

We do not need to be in a job that is comfortable, but in a job that we feel has purpose.  Often
that purpose is providing for our family, or it could be to demonstrate how Jesus would function in
the workplace.

"Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people.
 Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and that the Master you are
 serving is Christ." 
- Colossians 3:23

Reflect on the above scripture and ask the hard question, "Am I where God put me and am I willing to
thrive there?".  This simple question may be the key to your transformation at work.


## Emotional Transformation

How can we yield our emotions to God?

Even though we seldom realize it, our lives are controlled by our emotions. We like to think of
ourselves as being rational beings, with a little emotion added to make us human.  We
are truly emotional beings with a little rational behavior bolted on.

There is a spectrum of how we experience our emotions.  On one end some of us act directly out of
our current emotional state.  Whatever we feel defines our reality and our behavior is a direct
result.

Others of us are completely out of touch with our emotions.  That does not mean that we do not have
feelings, but rather we actively suppress them.  Stoic people believe that expressing emotions
(other than anger) is a sign of weakness and so they avoid any emotional situations whenever
possible.

No matter where we find ourselves on this spectrum we need the Spirit of God to transform us from
the inside out.  Emotional Intelligence is a measure of our emotional maturity and resilience.
There is no self-help teaching that can show us how to become more mature.

Emotional transformation is the result of the Spirit revealing God's tremendous love for us.  This
is a supernatural experience that only God can provide. The result of soaking in God's love is
that we are able to face our emotions in the light of reality.

If we are naturally led by emotions then we can acknowledge their presence without having to be
controlled by them.  If we have a habit of ignoring our emotions then we can welcome feelings as
they come.  Learning to feel again will take us to the next level of embracing life.

Jesus said that he came to bring us abundant life.  Embracing emotional health is a key part of
the abundant life that Jesus is offering us.  

Spend a few minutes inviting the Spirit to speak with you on this topic.  You may be amazed by all
that he has to say.


## Financial Transformation

Money is central to every aspect of our lives. What you love most will govern how you live your
life.  If you truly love money you cannot love God.  One will always win out over the other.

So what does it mean to be transformed in our thinking about money?  Jesus discussed money more that
any other subject in his teaching.  He clearly understood that unless we can love God more than
ourselves then we will never follow him in a way that matters.

There are three areas where our thinking must be transformed

### Contentment

If we do not feel that we are satisfied with what we have now then it is very unlikely that we will
ever be satisfied.  As resources grow so do our expectations about what is needed for happiness.
Even billionaires need a new helicopter.  We must learn to be content starting now.

### Generosity

We need to think in terms of service to others rather than serving ourselves. The happiest people
that I know are also the more generous.  This is no coincidence.  God made us to connect with
others and that requires that we invest time, energy, and our money.  If you don't make the
investment then you are missing out on an extremely important chance to experience God's blessing
flowing through you.

### Simplicity

Being aligned with God's purpose has a profound influence on every aspect of our lives.  Discovering
his purpose causes us to get rid of everything that would prevent that from happening.  Simplifying
our lives occurs naturally in order for us to use the resources that we manage in a way to bring
God's presence to those around us.

Spend a few minutes and think about your own journey.  How have you struggled with the issues of
contentment, generosity, and simplicity?  Are you making progress?

Next share your journey with someone that you trust.  Ask what they see in your life.  It will
probably be an amazing discussion.


## Physical Transformation

We live in a body.  Therefore our physical health has a profound impact on everything in our lives.
A problem in our body quickly becomes a problem for our mind and soul.

Our bodies are a dwelling place for the presence of God. Transformation means embracing his plan
of health and vitality for us.  Remaining as healthy as possible is important to everything else
that might happen.

Neglecting the care of our bodies thwarts all of the plans that God has for us. Ultimately this is a
spiritual issue with significant consequences.  The question before us is, "Will we choose to
follow Jesus in taking care of ourselves?"

Holistic care is comprehensive and includes what we eat, controlling weight, getting sleep, remaining
free from addiction, staying out of bar fights, and defensive driving.  Life is uncertain; there is
no guarantee of longevity or high-quality life.  But neglecting health issues is a sure path to a
low-quality life on every level.

Take time for personal reflection and ask yourself:  

1. What does holistic health mean to me?  
2. What small changes can I make to improve my health?
