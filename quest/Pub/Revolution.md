# The Dynamics of Revolution

### Prime Directive

The first goal of any empire is to make the empire expand.  Breadth is sought by extending the
borders in every direction.   Depth seeks to make the empire more invasive of the lives of its
subjects.  

Empires exist for the benefit of the elite ruling class and use the common people to build the
prosperity of the empire.  It is vital to strike a balance between increased wealth and prosperity
for the rich and the burden placed on the common people.

If the empire exploits the people beyond a limit then unrest will build.  Over time this will turn
into full scale revolt as it did in the Americas in 1776.


### A New Country

The revolution was a success but the consequences were far different than anyone could have
predicted.  The royal family had been overthrown but the reign of terror had just started.  It
would be years before anything remotely like a normal life would be restored.

The Americans were supportive of the rebels, seeing it through the eyes of their own revolution. The
US Constitution was a document that had just been ratified the previous year and would dictate how
the new country would be led.  George Washington had taken office as President, refusing to be
king.

Democracy was a bold new experiment in modern times.  Democratic ideas had been tried throughout the
centuries and given the world some good governments in Croatia and Venice. But you would have to
look back all the way to ancient Greece to see the type of society that the Americans were hoping
to create.

Few believed that government by the Demos (Greek word for public) is even possible or desirable. How
could peasants be educated to a level where they would not simply destroy the government.  After
all, the citizens would eventually figure out how to control the public purse and vote themselves
all of the money.  Once this happened it was game over for the country.  But for now, the American
government was working and life was far better for the US citizens than it had been for them as
colonists.


### Another Revolution

The French had been very helpful in the American revolution, now it was their opportunity to
reinvent their government structure.  Perhaps they would adopt the same Constitution that the
Americans had just ratified?  Certainly they would learn from the revolutionaries in America.

But that was not what happened.  The revolution was merely the beginning of many years of suffering
for the masses.  Instead of freedom, the revolution brought waves of violence and fear.  Public
executions became a sick form of entertainment for the survivors, until it was their turn to serve
the guillotine.

Why were the French and American revolutions so different?  Why did one bring freedom while the
other brought death? The key to understanding this lies with the leaders of the two rebellions.  We
must understand what motivated them by examining what they believed to be true.


### Freedom and Equality

It is human nature to want to make a better life for me and people exactly like me.  What is unusual
is the desire to want a better for life for someone that is not like me.  There is nothing
admirable or heroic in fighting for your own rights. But if you fight for the rights of the
defenseless then you are a true hero.

The American revolutionaries were far more concerned with the long-term sustainability of the
government that was being established.  Guys such as Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
Paul Revere, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington all spent countless hours arguing with each
other about the very ideals that would carry the new country forward.

These amazing leaders were able to look beyond their own interests to the interests of distant
generations.  The system they set up has served us well for over two centuries.  I hope that it
will continue to last.  That will depend on what we do next.


### Winner Takes All

The French revolutionaries stand out in stark contrast to the Americans.  The leaders that took
control were motivated by self-interest that led them to ruthless acts of brutality.  Their slogan
was Liberty, Equality, and Brotherhood, but the reality could not have been farther from the truth.
You are one of us until we believe that you are our enemy.

In France, the country was led by warlords who were each competing for power, and all dissent was
suppressed with extreme prejudice.  The revolution was exported to all of its neighbors and within
years all of Europe was in flames. Every citizen was forced to serve the army and its massive
military build-up.  Napoleon raised an army of one million men to attack Russia and returned in
defeat with around 30,000.


### Our Challenge

The French revolution failed to benefit its citizens because it was based on a bad foundation.  The
American leaders were driven by a deep moral conviction that they needed to defend the defenseless.
You can hear it in their own words,
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
 their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
 of Happiness."

If we lose this morality we lose everything.  It may take years for the despair to come but it will
eventually catch us.  I choose to devote my energy to the ideals of America's founders.  I hope
that there are many of us that are deeply committed to preserving the peace that we enjoy by
promoting a more just and equal society where everyone can thrive.
