## My Superpower

## Unique Powers

With great power comes great responsibility.  I believe that everyone has a
unique gift that I like to refer to as a superpower.  It took me a long time
to identify and clarify this concept in my own life, and even longer to learn
to use my superpower appropriately.

I'm writing this article to help you identify your superpower and get the most
out of your unique personality.  Everyone is equipped with different
characteristics that make them special.  Each person has some raw talent that
makes them super special.  Developing this talent into a strength requires years
of practice and study.  It is neither automatic nor certain.

Talents are developed into strengths by practice, experimentation, and study.
No Olympic athlete or genius is born that way.  There must be a talent present, 
but this can easily lay dormant. Conscious practice is what adds the skill and
knowledge required to create the strength.  Your superpower is that one strength
that makes you shine.

## Finding Your Destiny

Destiny is fully activating my superpower.  It requires many hours of practice 
and learning. The result is that I live a life that is optimized around my 
true potential.  On the other hand, it is impossible to live out my destiny
until my superpower is harnessed.  Raw talent is not the same as destiny if left
untrained.

My superpower is what gives meaning to my life.  When I use my powers for good I
experience outrageous joy. Something resonates deep within my spirit that tells
me this what I have been created to do.  Birds fly, fish swim, and beavers chew
trees.  They don't choose it - they are compelled to be who they are.

Each person has a superpower that defines their true destiny. Sadly many people
fail to discover their powers and never fully develop them.  They live out their
lives hoping to find meaning and purpose while not ever seeing what makes them
unique.  People in this mode often focus on what others have that they lack and
are in danger of being consumed by jealousy.

I discovered my powers during adolescence in much the same way as mutants in the
X-Men graphic novels become aware of their powers.  It is almost never pretty
and it is the failure to control the powers properly that attracts attention
first.  Over time I have learned to apply my powers for good and avoid the
dangers inherent in them.

## Fifty Year Plan

During my twenties, I wanted nothing more than to be like others.  My thirties
brought me the insight that I had special abilities that few others had. During
my forties, I began to see that my entire life revolved around my special
abilities and that fully developing these abilities was the key to happiness.
During my fifties, I realized that every power has a corresponding weakness and
vulnerability that must be addressed.

This leads us to the following plan for your personal growth

- 20s - identify what makes you special
- 30s - build your powers
- 40s - apply your power for good
- 50s - embrace your weakness
- 60s - learn to pass on your power to others

With this simple fifty-year plan you will have the ability to fully develop and
use your superpowers for good rather than evil.


## What is Your Superpower?

It is about what makes you unique.  What raw talents do you possess that could
be the basis of your superpower?  Don't wait for the radioactive spider or the
gamma-ray experiment to give you special powers. Make a plan to develop your 
talents.

What is stopping you from your destiny? What skills do you need to learn to
allow you to be the extraordinary person you can be?  Begin to lay out a plan
to build a better you.  Hire a coach that can help you with the personal 
disciplines that will be required.  Find someone who is further down the path
that you want to walk.

Start today.  Build the life you want to live, or sit on the sidelines and let
the opportunities pass by.  We all have constraints and limitations to work
around but the stakes are high. Now is the time to focus on building your 
destiny.  The most important thing that you can do is to identify and develop
your superpower.
