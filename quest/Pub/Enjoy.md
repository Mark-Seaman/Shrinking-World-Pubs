# Embracing Joy Daily

## Embracing an Alternate Lifestyle

I grew up in a culture that was obsessed with success.  I found myself chanting
along with my friends and family. "More, more, more".

This was somewhat true of me throughout my thirties.  But by forty I was already
beginning to think differently.  Now I am consciously choosing to seek less, not 
more.  This is amazing hard to do.  Everything in our culture demands that chase
after success.  Advertisements bombard us with messages to entice us to buy and
spend and work constantly to pay for it all.

I believe that there is a much better way to live.  Several principles can lead
us all the a much richer and deeper life. But I warn you it is very 
counter-cultural, and you are likely to face a lot of opposition from others.


### Contentment


    "We spend money we don't have, 
    on things we don't need, 
    to make impressions that don't matter." 
    -- Tim Jackson

We chase after many things that will never make us happy.  When we choose to be
content with who we are, what we have, and what we do, then life is greatly
improved.

Desiring things we can not attain is the cause of a great deal of stress in our
lives.   Avoiding the pursuit of more also lets us avoid the cost of seeking
that next purchase, promotion, or bigger house. Contentment can be a true source
of happiness.


### Simplicity

Distinguishing between needs a wants is the key to getting everything that we
truly need.  Most of us will be able to meet all of our needs and still have
energy to pursue some of our desires beyond that. The principle behind
simplicity is to organize our expectations around needs.

When it comes to making sacrifices we do not sacrifice our needs to get our
wants.  Our lives are simple because they remain focused on the essential
ingredients.  This prioritization of needs over wants protects us against
creeping expectations.

The Principle of Simplicity starts with a clear assessment of true human needs.
I have found the work of 
[Abraham Maslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow) 
quite helpful as a starting point.  I
recommend that you make this both personal and specific.  Here is my list
of what I need to be happy.

* Physical Survival
    - Food, Water, Sanitation, Clothing
    - Sleep, Health
    - Transportation, Shelter
    - Money to survive ($50,000/year)
* Safety & Security
    - Personal freedom to make choices
    - Secure job & money
    - Free from threat of violence
    - Feeling secure
* Community & Belonging & Trust
    - Need for community is hardwired
    - We deny our humanity when we act only as individuals
    - We are optimized to function as groups not individuals
    - Post industrial society does not function in large groups
    - Combat produces deep bonds of commitment (ultimate brotherhood)
* Respect & Esteem (self-respect, respect of others)
    - How I see myself and how I think others see me
    - Am I successful? Am I good enough?
    - Accept my strength and weakness
    - Awareness - embrace reality - good and bad
    - Brain constantly monitoring status and fairness to signal danger
* Life Purpose
    - Very few people understand their life purpose
    - Destiny is living up to my full potential
    - Living out my calling

Anything that does not appear on this list is not something that I need.  
There are many other items that I want but I am clear about the distinction.
I try not to sacrifice a need for a want.

There is also a limit to how much of each of these items make up the true need.
For example, consider the area of "Respect & Esteem" and the need to feel 
successful.  There is a legitimate need to feel successful, yet there is an 
extreme desire to be wildly successful that is unhealthy. Think about the limits
that you would set on each of these areas of true need.

### Generosity

We choose to live our lives in a way that is either open or closed to the needs
of others.  If we have a value for loving others we must have a lifestyle of
serving others.

There must be a balance between what others want from us and what we want for
ourselves.   Healthy relationships can only happen as we learn to be generous
with what we have.

This involves our time, energy, and money.  We cannot say we love others until
we are ready to make an active sacrifice for their welfare.
