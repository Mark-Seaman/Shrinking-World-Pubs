I have violated these most of my life because I did not believe they were real.


## Control

I control myself, but cannot control others.

    Key Question:  What do I control?

    Answer:   
        I control what I do, say, think, or feel.
        I do not control what others do, say, think, or feel.

    Implications:
        I am fully responsible for myself.
        I must accept the reality that others define for me.

    Personal Resolve:
        I will focus on what I control.
        I will not focus on what I don't control.


## Positivity

Managing emotions is essential to happiness.

    Key Question:  What is positive in the situation?

    Answer:   
        Our brains are far more sensitive to the pain than pleasure (by 4x)
        so focusing on the negative feeling produces deadly results.

    Implications:
        What I choose to focus on can have a profound impact on how I experience life.
        Every situation has a mix of positive and negative aspects.
        Emotions can and must be managed.

        I focus on the positive.
        I will avoid focus on the negative.


## Resources

An attitude of gratitude is the key to contentment.

    Key Question:  What do I have?

    Answer:   
        What I do is limited by the resources that I have.

        Resources can and must be managed.
        I can take inventory of assets I have: 
            Wealth, Status, Education, Skills, Influence, Relationships

    Personal Resolve:
        I focus on the positive.

        I will avoid all goals that are not quite right for me.


## Engagement/Mindfulness

    Answer:   
        Now is the only time I have to make choices.
        Thoughts of "What if" and "If only" (future/past) pull me from the 
        present reality.

        The future can hold infinite bad possibilities.
        Obsession with the future can limit taking action right now.
