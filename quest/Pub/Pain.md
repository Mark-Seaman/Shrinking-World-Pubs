# Learning from Pain


## Learning From Pain

Life is filled with difficulties and struggles; they are unavoidable.
Perseverance through the struggle helps us grow.

Pain is a refining process that ultimately leads us to a richer life and
wholeness. During this time when our faith is tested we need to gain
understanding, which comes from God.

Sometimes when we ask for wisdom we are not willing to embrace the truth of
reality as it is. Unless we are brutally honest we will never gain any
meaningful insight, since our minds and hearts are closed. As a result we will
flounder with no answers indefinitely.

Our viewpoint on our circumstances is often wrong, giving us a very shallow
understanding of reality. In God's economy, wealth and poverty mean nothing.  We
can live out a meaningful life only by seeking God's specific purpose.

Difficulties can teach us about meaning and purpose.  But during this process we
are tempted to give up and turn away from God which will lead us to destroy
ourselves.  Only by persevering and learning will we benefit from the struggle.
We must be patient and find the truth that the Lord would teach us.

God's plan for us is wholly good, but along the way we will experience sorrow
and pain. This will cause us to grow and lead us toward the perfection that God
already sees in us. He has a plan and purpose that is unique to each of us, but
refinement is needed to get us to the place where we can embrace his plan.

Our emotions frequently block our progress and stop God's purpose for us. It
does no good to hear the truth without embracing it.  We must see reality as it
is rather than as we want it to be. Otherwise we are just fooling ourselves.  If
our actions are not aligning with God's truth, it is clear that we are not
embracing reality.

Growth can happen as a result of suffering, but it depends on how we deal with
it.  It might be a valuable experience or it could be totally wasted.  This
largely depends on how we react to the pain that we feel.  Does it move us to
seek God or to draw away.  It is a choice.

## Discovery Comes Incrementally

I'm a better person than I've ever been before but worse than I will ever be
again.  Hopefully every month that passes will see real progress in my
understanding.  Personal growth is a lifelong and continuous investment.  Every
new experience offers an opportunity to learn and grow.

Each new insight builds understanding that is compounded.  Learning
is a process of exponential growth that makes future growth even easier.  Every 
lesson learned produces confidence for overcoming new challenges.

Over time, I am able to recognize problems early and address them.  A small
dysfunction can be dealt with before it develops into full-scale mental illness.
Absolute honesty is needed for the increased self-awareness required
to grow and mature.

Each victory spawns greater confidence to address issues earlier, resulting in a
commitment to continuous growth.  Over a lifetime this has a profound impact on
our  overall quality of life. The difference between people that deal with
emotional issues and those that do not is like day and night.


## Pay Attention to Pain

Pain is a great teacher.  Identifying areas of unresolved and recurring pain can
quickly highlight the next advancement. A painful situation or conversation is a
true opportunity for learning.  It reveals a sore spot where healing should take
place.  We ignore this pain at our peril and miss the chance to understand what
is causing this pain.

I've started keeping a Pain Journal to capture these moments.  During the heat
of the moment I lack the objectivity needed to grow from the experience, but
later this can be a valuable indicator that something needs attention.  This
pain journal is used later after the situation is cooled and provides examples
of the specific issues that must be addressed.


## Analyzing Pain

To look at your pain is a bit like looking into the Palantir from Lord of the
Rings.  It can be a terrifying and unnerving experience to learn things about
myself that I would rather not know.  But courage is always rewarded when it
comes to personal honesty.

The process of analyzing the pain in my life is very straightforward, but also
exhausting.  In involves the following steps:

* Relive the moment 
* Write an angry letter 
* Learn why 
* Repent and seek forgiveness
* Receive love and healing

Each of these steps takes me closer to understanding the true nature of the
problem.  Each step is a step toward healing.  Sadly I often lack the courage to
walk this path, and choose the path of denial instead.  Ultimately, denying a
problem exists allows it to fester and breed, eventually consuming my entire
life. Facing it head-on is the only solution that works.


## Relive the Moment

It is astoundingly easy to relive painful experiences from years ago.  Emotion
memory does not fade; pain can have a lasting impact.  The first step toward
healing is like choosing to open Pandora's Box.  You must be certain that you
are committed to the journey.

Bring the painful moment back into the light; relive the horror you felt.   Pain
has four faces: Anger, Fear, Sadness, and Shame. Our most painful experiences
are a blend of all four of these aspects.  I dwell here just long enough to get
the adrenaline pumping.  This gets me the motivation to resolve the issue.

I am amazed by how fresh and raw my most painful experiences are from my
childhood.  It was like those thing just occurred.


## Write an Angry Letter 

I process things by writing.  Other process things by talking them out.
When I need to work out any problem it is helpful for me to put pen to paper
(or more aptly, fingers to keys).  I write down all of my grievances and
concerns.

The main objective for doing this is to accurately and dramatically describe the 
turmoil that I feel.  I intentionally use my whining voice and complain about
everything that I would have sense not to tell another person.  The goal is to
express maximum emotion to try and capture the most extreme version of the 
conflict.

Later this writing always appears intensely juvenile and self-centered.  Part of
the value of this step for me is to illustrate how unjustified my feelings are
even though they are so deeply felt.

I then convert all of these complaints into a letter to the Universe (or some 
faceless uncaring deity like Odin or Zeus).  Targeting one of these gods reduces
the amount of repenting I need to do in a later stage of processing.


## Ask Why

I let some time go by and let my subconscious stew on the angry letter.  
Sometimes I think of additional things that really torqued me off.  I view the
letter as a working document, that describes everything that is wrong with my
life.  At some point it begins to feel rather ridiculous. 

Describing my pain in writing is a starting point for examination.
Why the strong negative emotions?  What is really causing that?  I dive in at
this point; there is no turning back now.  I must find the root cause of the
issue so that I can receive the healing I so badly need.

Humans are complex beings.  Our emotions are deeply layered.  The first time we
ask why we feel a certain way, we get only a superficial answer.  We must dig
deeper by asking why that is so.  To trace the true problem I typically need  to
ask "Why?" five times, sorting through the layers.   This lets me uncover the
layers all of way down to the central issue.

At the core of every big problem is a lie that I believe to be true.  The lie
has already caused me a great deal of pain so I want to never forget what I
just learned. The newly discovered lie becomes a feature article in a newspaper 
that I publish for my eyes only.  

"Lies I Believe" makes for gripping reading whenever I begin slipping back into
darkness.  It can provide an instant jolt  of reality.   It allows me to scoff
at my old foolishness and feel superior to my past self for how wise I now am.
We all need a little humor in these dark  times.


## Repent and Seek Forgiveness 

Writing about the myths that I have subscribed to goes a long way toward 
bringing the issues into the open.  Putting words to the lie reveals the
inevitable falsehood of the situation.  Then I ask why this lie has had so
much power over me.

The next step is to repent from this flawed thinking and choose a more 
life-giving path.  I confess the sinfulness of these lies to God and them I find
a human that I can confide in.  This is someone that I trust deeply.

There is a natural accountability that emerges from this confidence that is 
shared.  A deeper bond of trust is developed each time we choose to trust 
another personal with our dirt.


## Receive Love and Healing 

This trust will lead automatically to a deeper level of conversation and
understanding.   My issues may actually be shared by the other and so bring
redemption to them as a bi-product. 

Anyone I share with will automatically begin praying for me and will likely 
inquire about the related issue later.  This begins a healthy interaction and
a supportive cycle of growth.  

The camaraderie that develops as a result is priceless.  This is no surface
relationship but a deep commitment to see each other prosper.  All too often, 
we settle for so little out of fear of disclosure.  We believe that if someone
really understood our weakness then they would reject us.
