# When Hunger Comes Home

## Impact of Hunger

Those who have not experienced hunger cannot fully understand the devastating
impact that it has.  Fortunately, this includes me.   I have never gone to bed
hungry, even though I was only one generation from abject poverty.

Like most Americans I have lived an insulated life and experienced many of the
privileges tied to the time and place of my birth.  Extreme poverty is mostly
related to the family that we are born into.  If you have been born in poverty
it is very difficult to break out.


## Seeing the Need

Unfortunately, my reality it not everyone's.  There are many that lack basic needs for
survival through no fault of their own. Those who live lives of privilege are
reluctant to see the need, because it demands that we accept responsibility.

It is time that we move to respond to the need around us.  The pandemic has
revealed how bad things have gotten in America.  The wealth gap is the largest
that it has been in over 100 years. 


## Wealth and Poverty

Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos hold the wealth of 40% of the poorest Americans.  The
richest 0.1% hold almost the combined wealth of the bottom 90%.  This doesn't
feel quite right.  But we regular people can do little about this except to 
agitate our leaders to care for the poor.

The pandemic has also had a devastating impact on the poorest people, and made
survival very difficult.  They have no resources and so have no margin in their
lives. Children suffer the most.  Disaster falls unevenly when it comes. 
Those at the bottom take the
brunt.


## The Right to Eat

I believe that everyone should eat.  This is a cause that I am personally
committed to. Poverty has cousins and other problems that it produces. But hunger is
something that is readily addressable.  Investing is good for everyone. 
Producing a safety net creates benefits that far outweigh the cost.

Responding to suffering is not an all or nothing proposition. No one can do
everything, but everyone can do something. Be practical; be proactive.  Act
simply - act immediately.  


## The Call to Act

While this is important for all people it is absolutely critical for church people.
For anyone who expresses a faith in God, this is not optional.  In fact, care for
those in poverty is the way that you demonstrate your faith.  It is absurd that
people would focus on evangelism without caring for those in need.  This is
the true test of spiritual legitimacy.

Several years ago, our church embarked on a journey to embrace three initiatives
in our community: End Hunger, Seek Justice, Strengthen Families.  During the
pandemic all three of these initiatives took on new meaning, not only for us but
for our community.  We realized at a gut-level that to follow Christ is to serve
the poor and disadvantaged.


## Acting to End Hunger

We created a food pantry and began giving out food. We partnered with other
community organizations to help feed people.  Over the last several years we
have been expanding our impact as we learn how to be more effective.  
During 2019 we distributed 900
pounds of food to perhaps 50 families.

When the pandemic hit the need in our community skyrocketed.  We became aware
that many were beginning to starve and these were mostly children.  I've seen
the photos of lines for soup kitchens from the Great Depression but I never
dreamed it would happen here.  It breaks my heart to see people in such need.

As all churches were closed due to the quarantine, we realized that we had a unique
opportunity to serve our community.  We converted much of our church building to
food distribution.  Throughout 2020 and 2021 we have seen huge demand and are
seeking to respond.  The 900 pounds in 2019, has turned into 26,000 pounds of food
in 2020.   We have easily served 500 families. This is far larger that our small
congregation.


## The True Gospel

This feels like the Gospel to me.  There is so much hopelessness and grief in
the world right now.  And America is filled with angry, extremist, and arrogant 
voices.  This is
the opposite. Just regular people doing something good.  This feels like the
Good News to me - expressing God's love for those who are hurting.

Each one of us has a moral imperative to do the right thing. A crisis reveals
what we value most.  A crisis also transforms us into more of what we were
already becoming.  Who are you becoming in this time of crisis?  Is it who you
want to be?
