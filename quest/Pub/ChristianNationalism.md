# Christian Nationalism

I consider Christian Nationalism the single greatest threat to our national security.  I ran across
this as a series of Tweets and thought it was worth repeating.


### Top 10 Indicators

by Samuel Perry


In our studies we rely on survey questions to measure CN's distribution & impact among Americans.
But since folks can't pass around surveys, here's a diagnostic. 

TOP 10 INDICATORS YOU'RE SEEING CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM:

- **US VS. THEM.** Dead giveaway. If a professing Christian clearly sees non-Christians as enemies
    to be defeated, controlled, or kept separate rather than SERVED, LOVED, BEFRIENDED, etc.,
    they're thinking as CN culture warrior. The idea of dying for the unworthy is repellent.
- **CULTURE VS. PERSON** When a Christian talks about the "Christianity" people need, does it sound
    like they're talking about a "culture" (values, morals, worldviews, behaviors) or a person
    (Jesus). CN isn't about folks meeting Jesus; it's about white conservative dominance.
- **CONTEMPT FOR THE CROSS** Christians don't take up their cross in #ChristianNationalism. Because
    real Christians don't lose in this life. They win. Laying down one's rights for one's enemies
    is like surrendering. It's un-American; for losers. Therefore it's also unChristian.
- **OT ISRAEL = AMERICAN CHRISTIANS** If a Christian's telling you how Jesus-followers should live
    as Americans & their theological paradigm is how Israel was instructed to live in Canaan,
    you've got CN (ethnic conquest, blood & cultural purity, theocracy) not NT Christianity.
- **NATIONAL RIGHTEOUSNESS = "PURITY."** This one piggybacks on the previous one. If someone's
    operating with OT Israel in Canaan as their paradigm, they'll be very concerned with
    America's "faithfulness" which boils down to religious & sexual purity, NOT justice, fairness,
    etc.
- **AMERICA = CENTRAL TO GOD'S PLANS** Even if they warn God will withdraw his hand from America for
    impurity, they still believe God has a special relationship w/the USA cuz we're "founded on
    Biblical principles," etc. Thus, it's always AMERICA FIRST & God wants it that way.
- **CULTURE OF DEATH** This one's tricky cuz CN will be strongly anti-abortion. But CN will also be
    pro-guns, pro-military, pro-death penalty, anti-mask, anti-precautions, and anti-healthcare for
    the poor. The abortion stance is authoritarianism, not concern for the vulnerable.
- **SELECTIVE BIBLE QUOTING** Like any heresy, CN selectively quotes the Bible. Favorite Bible
    quotes will be: -Jesus expelling money changers. -Romans 13: submitting to
    authority. -Patriarchy stuff -Stuff about forgiveness & judging (only when their leaders are
    immoral idiots.)
- **LACK OF CONCERN FOR "WITNESS"** This goes back to "us vs. them." When "they"
    (infidels, non-whites) are the enemy, who cares what they think? Of course they'll hate you.
    And you hate them. Screw them. Better to dominate them & then it really doesn't matter what
    they think.
- **CONSPIRATORIAL VICTIM MINDSET** When your whole reality is culture war & "us vs. them," you must
    constantly be vigilant that everyone in power (media, scientists, non-CN politicians) are
    lying & out to get you. So everything is conspiracy & everyone is screwing you over.
