# Relating to People

## Social Anxiety

One of my most troubling personal attributes is my desire to gain approval from others.  I want
everyone to think that I am awesome, especially in those areas where I am least awesome.   I have a
true desire to share my life honestly with others, but this is frequently at odds with the desire
to look good.

Some people process their thoughts by talking them out with others.  This does not really work for
me. Social interactions are generally difficult for me. When I am talking with someone about an
important topic, 80% of my brain is occupied with assessing reactions and critiquing the
conversation.  Most  of my energy is devoted to monitoring the interaction itself, leaving little
room for the actual topic. 

As an introvert, sharing weakness or vulnerability requires a large amount of courage.  When I am
involved in a discussion I am usually guarded about what I share. I spend a great deal of time
analyzing conversations later and often regret how open I was, and usually give myself a rather
harsh critique. These regrets make it difficult for me to feel comfortable sharing my feelings.

But I have many close relationships that do not have this problem.  Once I know and trust someone it
is easy for me to be open and honest.  The lingering impulse still exists to cover up my faults and
try to impress.  It takes courage to be vulnerable and it is usually worth the effort.


## Cost of Connection

Social interactions leave me drained and exhausted.  Every exchange of ideas and opinions requires
the pre-game preparation, the half-time adjustments, and the post-game analysis with my internal
commentators.  The total analysis requires about three times longer than the interaction itself,
making the typical cost of connecting far larger than the emotional benefit.

The more intense discussions carry an even bigger emotional burden.  The net result is that
connecting with people requires a great deal of  energy for me. At the same time, it is a huge part
of what makes life worthwhile, so I dare not neglect it.

Low quality relationships require the same energy level for me as the great ones. Those are the
people that I will probably never be close friends with. Making new acquaintances  is very
difficult for me since those new relationships will probably never get to a level that feels worth
the cost.

I already have existing close connections with people that I love and that love me.  It is difficult
for me to imagine that the new acquaintances offer the same opportunity. Overall, I tend to
evaluate relationships through the lens of "return on investment". The people that I am most
connected with are the ones that I want to continue to invest in.

Is it worth the effort to connect?  For my closest friends the answer is clearly a resounding "yes",
but for casual relationships I would rather not spend the effort. I prefer to devote all my
relational energy building lasting trust with the twenty-five people that I already know and
trust.


## Ambiguous Relationships

Studies have shown that relationships are vital to our well-being.  Negative, critical, and
controlling people can seriously harm our motivation and cause us to give up and disengage from our
work or life in general.

A supportive relationship can have the opposite impact.  Consistently positive interactions can
bring encouragement and allow us to persevere through difficult situations.  One supportive
relationship can make all the difference to our attitude and well-being.

Sometimes our relationships are not at all consistent.  They may alternate between supportive and
destructive.  Each interaction may bring encouragement or discouragement, affirmation or criticism.
These must be characterized as ambiguous relationships. 

Scientific studies have shown that ambiguous relationships are far more stressful to manage than
even the most antagonistic ones.  When we know that someone is consistently hostile we actively
avoid and oppose them, limiting the negative impact they might have on our life.  We remain guarded
because we know that they can not be trusted.

An ambiguous relationship on the other hand lures us into a false sense of security.  A few good
interactions and we let down the defenses.  Then the trust is broken and we find ourselves under
attack with no defenses.

These caustic interactions force us to be on high alert with every interaction. We do not know if we
are talking to Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde (Bruce Banner or the Hulk).  As a result every interaction is
fraught with peril and extremely hazardous.


## Abusive Relationships

Over time, ambiguous relationships often take an abusive turn.  The aggressor becomes  increasingly
forceful in asserting their will. The victim is expected to react gracefully to boundary
violations, give in to every demand, and to always placate the abuser.  The victim is blamed for
the problems in the relationship and expected to be the one to seek reconciliation.

The positive interactions that occur lead the victim to hope that the relationship can be  redeemed.
This gives to victimizer an opportunity to discover the next point of vulnerability that can be
exploited.  Appeasement is not a long-term option since the end goal is nothing short of absolute
surrender.

The only workable solution is a strong defense. Clearly determined boundaries must be established to
prevent the abuser from taking over.  Most relationships rely on the general goodwill and self
awareness of each party to maintain the healthy  connection.  But when the relationship is abusive
these critical elements are missing.

Once a relationship turns abusive there is no hope for true reconciliation.  The best outcome is a
cessation of hostilities and a formal truce.  This kind of interaction requires a huge amount of
emotional investment and by necessity must be limited.  The victim must determine how often to
interact with the abuser and control the circumstances to match.

Abusive relationships have left me unable to fully trust people.  The effect of these harmful
interactions has spilled over into other relationships. I feel attacked and threatened when there
is no good reason.  I am guarded when I should be trusting.


## Childhood Memories

I would love to be healed of the hurts from my past.  A sign of healing would be how I remember my
past.  Each time I recall my childhood it is with deep pain. I know that I must have had some
life-giving moments but I find them very difficult to recall.

My childhood memories revolve around the strong emotions of Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Shame.  When
looking at photos I am overwhelmed with a sense of loss for all the things that were missing.  The
tears that come are not happy ones!

I believe, as healing takes place, I will be able to remember the good things that happened to me as
a child.  But unfortunately I am not there yet.  I do believe that healing is possible and I am
hoping that I will experience it someday.
