# Emotional Health

### Understanding my humanity

My entire life I have struggled to understand the power that my emotions have
over me. We would like to believe that we are rational beings with emotions, but
we are actually emotional beings who rationalize.  The big decisions in our
lives are all emotional ones.  We use our intellect to try and justify what we
have decided, to others and ourselves.  

I find this reality to be deeply disturbing but it is based in the design of the
human brain.  Our brains are a true work of art.  The entire system is meant to
be robust and function in a wide variety of environments.

But there are some profound weaknesses in the system that lead to common
failures.  The study of psychology is intended to understand how humans think. 
But until the 1980s was focus almost exclusively on the dysfunctions (pathology)
of the brain.  [Positive
psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology) focuses the
attention on the potential that humans have rather than the failures we
experience.

I have read many books on the subject and spent countless hours trying to apply
these principles in my life.  In this article I would like to share the best of
what I know about how to be happy and content.  The journey begins with a true
desire embrace reality as it exists rather than as we wish it to be.  Without an
objective viewpoint we cannot really hope to make meaningful progress toward
emotional health.

Moving toward emotional maturity is a lifelong journey.  A daily investment is
required to learn and grow.  There will be victories and defeats along the way. 
We never reach the ultimate destination, but we will observe measurable results
based on the effort we expend.


### Positive and Negative Emotions

I believe that emotional maturity is measured by our ability to manage pleasure
and pain in our lives.  In fact, the definition of maturity for me is the
ability to have a appropriate response of pleasure and pain to match the current
circumstances.

Note that this is different that optimize pleasure while minimizing pain.  Both
of these are necessary responses depending on the situation.  It is unhealthy to
have an inappropriate response to the world that we live in.

Our brains are wired physiologically to produce
[neurochemicals](https://www.dana.org/article/neurotransmitters/) for both
pleasure and pain.  This is a fully automatic response that we cannot prevent.
Different chemicals signal different emotional responses: anger, fear, shame,
sadness, joy, love.  Both the positive and negative emotions release a chemical
response within our bodies.

One difficulty we face is that the system is tuned toward the negative emotions.
 The pleasure response is about 1/4 of the total impact of the negative
response.  Our brains want us to be angry, fearful, sad and ashamed, while
allowing us to be joyful on occasion.


### Four Faces of Pain

There are many different types of pain that we experience, but as I've thought
about this, they can all be grouped into four main clusters.  The many nuances
of pain can be represented by the larger emotion. I believe, based on what I've
read, that these four emotions are represented by specific chemical response
patterns in the brain.

* **Anger** happens when I do not get my way - when someone or something is
believed to be blocking an important goal.  This makes me ready to fight.
* **Fear** happens when I believe that something bad is about the happen.  This
make me ready to run.
* **Sadness** is my response to painful circumstances or memories.  This causes me
to lose energy and resign myself the the inevitable.
* **Shame** this is the feeling of rejection and social isolation that I feel. 
This causes me to disconnect from others.

Many painful circumstances trigger all four of the faces of pain.  When thinking
about pain, it is helpful to examine each of type independently.  Understanding
my response to the situation can give clues into possible actions I can take to
find a remedy.


### Pain Antidotes

By looking at each type of painful emotion we can often see a remedy for what we
are feeling.  Each of these feelings has the answering response that can
mitigate our experience of pain.  Learning how to invoke these healthy responses
in the key to unlocking emotional health.

- **Anger - Humility**:  Anger is often based on a belief that we have a right to get our will.
- **Fear - Faith**:  Fear is a lack of trust that things will work out OK.
- **Sadness - Hope**: Sadness makes us believe in a future without hope.
- **Shame - Love**: Shame comes when we feel cut off from the love and acceptance we crave.

A process of transformation can start with me realizing that I am responsible
for my emotional state.  While the initial reaction is hard-wired in the brain
and involuntary, I have the ability to decide long-term what feelings I feed.  

Awareness of the emotions gives me the ability to use the rational part of my
brain as a regulator for the amygdala which is responsible for the
neurochemicals flooding my system. Scientific measurement show that with
practice I can learn to control my emotional response.  The converse is also
true I can choose to spin out of control and excite the amygdala to a greater
level.


### Path of Healing

The journey toward health begins with a simple realization that I am responsible
for my emotional health.  In the same way that I am responsible for my physical
health, I need to nurture and build healthy habits in my life.

This does not mean that my health is entirely within my control.  It is possible
to do everything correctly and have tragedy strike. But it does mean that any
misfortune will come from the outside and not be the result of my own neglect. 
Most tragedies are self-induced and a direct result of not paying attention or
taking responsibility for what can be controlled.

The choice to pursue redemption and healing must be followed up with a
commitment to become more aware of the feelings that drive my behavior. 
Awareness is the key to transformation.  Without it there will be little
progress made.  Time does not produce growth, but awareness can.

Deep transformation results from a serious investment over time.  It is
necessary to explore and experiment with differing ways to respond to common
situations so that the best  alternatives can be found.

The ultimate goal of transformation is to experience real connection with others
and ourselves and to find peace. This can't happen overnight, but it will happen
as I continue to lean into the things that matter.

A key aspect of emotional transformation is learning to forgive.   The act of
forgiving releases me from the bondage of past experiences and allows me to
fully embrace the future.  It is impossible to be connected to others that we
are unwilling to forgive.    The unforgiveness will act an anchor taking down
our relationships and sense of well-being with it.


### Embracing Truth

I have found that in my life there are four touchstones of health.  I hold these
up regularly to see how I am doing. I regularly set aside time to do an honest
evaluation of my state of mind.  This involves restating truths that I believe
and listening for the emotional resonance.

- **Humility** - It's not about me
- **Faith** - It will all be OK
- **Hope** - My life will be filled with good things
- **Love** - I will seek to give my life to others

Medieval monks had a practice that they called "The Examine" where they would
reflect deeply on a single experience to try and gain insight.  They would
select a recent experience that was either very positive or negative from
examination.  They would ask three questions.

- What made that experience so good or bad?
- How did I respond?
- What can be learned from this experience?

I've been doing this regularly for the last few years and find it extremely
helpful for amplifying the joy and understanding the pain.  I have learned to
recognize patterns of thought and behavior that repeat frequently.  This is a
great aid in fostering personal transformation.
