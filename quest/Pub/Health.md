# My Spiritual Journey

Over
the last year I have been on an amazing journey of spiritual growth.  As I enter
the final quarter of my life I have been reflecting deeply on the entire journey
and looking to how I will spend the remainder. 

I've been following Jesus now for 47 years, and attended around 7,500 church
services and small group meetings.  I've been involved in almost all aspects of
church leadership.  My life has been deeply committed to both personal growth
and the ministry of the church.

I've always focused on daily devotions and memorized blocks of scripture,
listening to over 5,000 sermons and reading 250 Christian books - learning has
always been a huge part of my life with God.

Ministry experiences have taken me on foreign missions trips and given me the
opportunity to be involved with miraculous healing.  We have always given over
10% of our family income to the church and paid for 30 years of Christian
schooling. We have sponsored many children and missionaries over the years.  We
have attended around  30 church conferences and countless leadership meetings.

When I look back over the years I am astounded at the amount of activity that we
have experienced and the extraordinary opportunities that we have had to grow
and learn.  For most of that time we have been in relatively healthy churches
that did the things that would lead people to grow in pursuit of Jesus. 

But if I am totally honest in assessing my spiritual life, I would have to
admit that I only embraced a shallow discipleship. It stopped far short of what
God would have for me.  I have largely exchanged a lot of activity for a deep
relationship and experience of God's presence. 

Throughout my life I have retained harmful behaviors and attitudes that deny the
presence of God's authority in my life.  I have been unable to overcome the
impact of past hurts. Rather than surrender completely, I have chosen to deny
and cover over the areas that remain unyielded to God. I was often experiencing
great turmoil on the inside while trying to look good to impress others.

I remained emotionally immature and in many cases completely unaware of my
feelings and the negative impact that they had on my life.  My experience of
God's love was extremely limited and my focus shifted toward learning and
serving.  Gradually my love for God was replaced by a sense of duty and the joy
of ministry evaporated.

Although I believed I was pursuing God's kingdom (his authority and his will), I
was really just building my own kingdom (self-effort and my will).  I had a very
selfish outlook and attempted to use God and others to pursue my own goals and
agenda. When these goals were opposed I grew angry and despondent. 

In many ways I led a dual life - carefully managing my public image to look holy
to others, while secretly being angry that I could not get my way.  This
discrepancy between how I wanted others to see me and the internal experience
was at the heart of much of my social and emotional dysfunction. This dissonance
grew for years and I refused to address it.

Several years ago I began to explore the practices of Spiritual Formation.   I
discovered that there were many others also grappling with these issues.  I
began to realize that my church experience had led me to live in denial rather
than admit my own brokenness. Over time, this caused me to embrace lies that were
damaging me by undermining redemption in my life.

The practices of Spiritual Formation were catalytic in my journey toward
healing. In particular the practices of Solitude, Silence, and Sabbath have
allowed me to break out of lifelong habits based on self-effort.  I have learned
how to recognize the urge to control others and the world around me.

I am being transformed from willfulness to willingness by embracing a consistent
attitude of repentance.  As I realize new areas of brokenness I can
acknowledge them freely and move toward healing.  This has made me much more
emotionally resilient and able to deal with situations that would have put me in
a state of crisis at earlier times.

This time with God has also allowed me to embrace reconciliation and forgiveness
more readily.  This has made me more loving and tolerant toward others.  I have
seen a significant growth in my relationships and find it easier to connect with
others.

I've also realized that my prayer life has been dramatically improved.  I used to
view prayer as a duty that I should do or as an attempt to tell God what he
needed to do for me.  Yes, I realize how bad this sounds.  Prayer for me
now is simply an act of being with God and listening for anything that he might
want to say.  Silence has taught me to simply listen and stop talking.   This is
a major breakthrough for me.  I now spend large blocks of time just enjoying
God.

My journey is far from complete, but I now see the path that I am walking on
into the future.
No single resource has had a greater impact on my spiritual growth than
[Emotionally Healthy Discipleship](https://www.amazon.com/Emotionally-Healthy-Discipleship-Christianity-Transformation/dp/0310109485) 
by Pete Scazzero.  His teaching is intensely
practical in a way that much teaching is not.  His 
[discipleship course](https://www.emotionallyhealthy.org/your-church/) is a proven
way to lead people toward a deep discipleship that transforms lives.
