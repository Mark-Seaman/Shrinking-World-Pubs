# Meaningful Work

At the very heart of meaningful work is the urge to create.  This can take on many forms. Creativity
may be expressed in writing, software design, teaching techniques or just plain old problem
solving.  A day without creativity is like a day without sunshine.


## Motivation

There are several core attributes of meaning in work life.  If any of these is missing it will be
impossible to have a sense of fulfillment related to work.  It is worth spending time regularly
thinking about the factors which provide the motivation that you need.

Aspects of motivation

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose
* Connection


### Autonomy

Each of us have a need to be free to choose what we work on as well as how and where we work.  That
is what makes micromanagement so devastating to motivation. As control over our decisions tightens
our autonomy disappears.  We must regain autonomy over our work in order to have productive
interaction with others.

Each person is accountable for results. Constraints on how the work is done should be expressed as
objectives, rather than directives. This amplifies the personal accountability that each person
feels for the goals of each project.

Every project has a boss of some kind (client, customer, manager).  The primary role of the boss is
to define what success looks like.  They set the constraints for a good outcome.  The worker on the
other hand must be responsible for the planning and execution that works within those constraints.

This involves a lot of problem solving that should be done by the worker, not the boss. If the boss
is trying to solve the interesting problems then the workers will quickly lose motivation because
it is clear that they are not being trusted to make any important decisions.

Another important aspect of autonomy for me is the ability to choose the projects that I work on and
who I work with.  This allows me to pursue my interests while meeting the goals of the project and
the organization.  It encourages me to develop creative ideas and solve problems


### Mastery

Everyone has a deep desire to be an expert at something.  This is an innate need for every human.
That is what explains why people would devote their free time to learning to play a musical
instrument or learning to speak a foreign language.

I desire to build my expertise and develop best practices that go far beyond the minimum
requirements for the task at hand.  Pride in accomplishments is developed along with skill and
knowledge.  Refinement and optimization come as new skills are practiced.

Skills take a great deal of practice to reach higher levels of proficiency. Developing skills
is not a linear progression but more like a series of plateaus that are reached. Each level
requires a fundamental change in behavior and understanding.
I've developed the
following scale to quantify the practice time required for different levels of skill.

Quantified Skill 

* Beginner - 10 hours
* Competent - 100 hours
* Proficient - 1000 hours
* Expert - 10,000 hours 

Creativity is another important aspect of mastery.  All people are creative but some have an
insatiable desire to express their creativity.  If this desire cannot be expressed as part of the
work role then the work will lose the potential benefit.

The creative process has a rhythm to it.   There is a workflow and a lifecycle that affects how
ideas are captured, nurtured, and developed.  If the work environment does not respect that natural
rhythm then the creativity of the workers will be completely lost.

Few creative people will tolerate being treated like a cog in a machine, doing menial task that do
not require much creativity.  If you want people that are masters then the environment must
encourage it.  Certain work environments have a culture of creativity where creatives can thrive.


### Purpose

Purpose is an essential part of happiness.  Without knowing that you are fulfilling the purpose of
your life you will be faced with a constant gnawing sense of discouragement, disillusion, and
anger.

Abraham Maslow, in 1943 highlighted five levels of essential human needs.  These must be addressed in
order of priority, from the basic physical needs to the thing that he identified
as "Self-actualization".  

In my thinking this highest level is about understanding your life purpose. What is the thing that
you are ideally suited to do that few others can even come close to? What uniqueness must you
express to be all that you can be?

When you can answer this question you are on track for describing your life purpose.  If you cannot
succinctly describe your purpose then you are very unlikely to live it out.

I recommend that you attempt to write your purpose using no more than seven words.  This forces you
to truly capture the essence and let go of the supporting clarifications.

Once you get to your seven-word motto, you can write a one page description that explains how this
works out in practice.  This is your filter. Everything that exists in your life should be there to
help you fulfill your purpose. If not then prune it.

Your purpose becomes your destiny as you move toward it. I believe that destiny is not about the
actions that we take but the person that we become. Over time, we become a certain kind of person,
by growing our capabilities and character to fulfill our life purpose.

The actions that we take are merely a bi-product of who we are becoming. Living out our destiny is
realizing the full potential of all the resources we have been given and living with a true
purpose.

Your purpose must involve helping others and not just stroking your own ego. You need a larger
vision that lets you see how the world around you can be improved.  Creating value for others and
influencing them to live a better life are both key ingredients that will lead you toward
fulfillment.


### Connection

Marcus Buckingham is one of the world leaders in the area of what makes humans perform at exceptional
levels.  In his research for the Gallup organization he discovered that the most important question
that signified happiness at work was, "Do you have a best friend at work?"  

People that have meaningful connections at work are smarter, more content, and work more
productively than others.  A sense of teamwork and interdependence is indispensable to high
performance.

Mutual respect, trust, and appreciation must be present to create a sense of mutual commitment that
is required to accomplish the work. A team must be able to learn and teach and work through
conflict. Without great teamwork a group will produce a small fraction of its true potential.

As teams jell a sense of community develops.  This is fertile ground for collaboration and
interdependence.  This creates a positive environment where everyone can flourish.
