# The Art of Deep Listening

Love cannot grow without increasing the skill of listening.  Every conversation in which I am not
fully present is a squandered opportunity for connection. Distractions often prevent us from truly
listening because we are focused on what we will say rather than what is being said.

Deep listening is used to allow me to truly engage with others.  

- Present (Distracted)
- Loving (Judging)
- Open (Closed to being changed)

When people feel heard they feel loved.  Many problems (70%) can be solved through active listening.
Connection happens when people listen.

When I judge people they are treated as objects instead of unique image bearers of God.   I
categorize people to diminish their humanity and make them unworthy of my love.  I make differences
into virtues of moral superiority.

Only God has the right and wisdom to judge another person.  When I judge, I am usurping God's role.
This is turning my back on God's kingdom (to my own kingdom).

I harbor judgmental attitudes of many differing types.

- My spouse for not doing life my way
- Close friends for their politics
- Adult children for their choices
- Coworkers for how well they work
- Everyone for not following Jesus the way I do
- Other generations for their choices and attitudes
- Different social class, race, ethnicity, appearance, or education
- Beliefs, values, and practices
- Movies, music, cars, houses, dress
- Other personality types
- Our leaders and all of their followers

Differences make me uncomfortable. I naturally believe that I am right and others are wrong. I judge
the differences in others to assert my moral superiority. Others naturally see the world
differently than I do, so I regularly judge almost everyone. Every person is unique in experience
and understanding, which leads them to fundamentally differing views of the world.

I can learn from the views of others, especially when I disagree with them. Every person has some
wisdom to teach that comes from the Spirit of God even though they may not know that their truth
comes from God.  A person does not need to be whole and healthy to speak the truth. Truly listening
allows us to receive the treasure from each person we interact with.

Technology has impacted our lives and dramatically impacted our ability to connect emotionally. The
tools that we use allow us to be in constant contact, yet avoid the true human connection required
for meaningful relationships.

Modern communication trades connection for convenience.  We trade emojis and likes for real
conversation.  We even convert words into acronyms to spend less effort on reusable phrases. All of
these shortcuts are without nuance and leave us feeling disconnected.
