# My Autistic Journey 


I always knew that I was significantly different from other people.  But I could
never understand why I was unable to connect emotionally to others. From my teen
years I struggled to feel like I belong to any group that I am associated with.

I have always had a lot of social anxiety and find dealing with groups of people
uncomfortable. I struggle to fit in even with people that I feel close to. 
Large groups of people make me very uncomfortable, in ways that most people can
never understand.


## Living as an Alien


Although I try to fit in, it is difficult for me to be myself in a group of
people.  I have long recognized that my brain functions differently than most
other people's.  I have rarely found others that understand me but when I do
there is instant camaraderie.

In our society, there are complex social rules that govern all of our
interactions.  Most of these rules are about establishing power structures and
status.

Conformity is highly valued in our social interaction.  Behaving in a way that
breaks the social norms of our society makes one an outcast.  My entire lifetime
I have struggled to understand the rules that others simply embrace intuitively.
This makes each conversation extremely difficult for me.


## Awakening - Breakthrough in understanding

While most of my life has been characterized by a feeling of alienation, I have
also discovered a community of people that are quite similar to me.  These
relationships have provided me with great camaraderie and friendship.  I used
to think that this bond was related to common interests, but now I see it as
much deeper than that.

There are people that are quite similar to me and yet very different than others.
The common connection is deep in the brain and how we process sensory input
and manage tasks and connections with others.  These folks share many characteristics
with me and I find myself instantly at home when I am with them.

When looking a any large group of people there will be a bell-shaped curve that
represents specific characteristics. I find myself 2-3 standard deviations out
on a cluster of thinking and behavioral patterns.

The traits cluster together to provide a mental profile that quite different
from the norm.  We can describe our group as being neuro-divergent, as opposed
to neuro-typical.


## Psychological Prognosis

Psychologists call my people autistic.  This is used to highlight the weaknesses
related to connecting with others.  For years, I was unable to accept 
this label because of the associated stigma.  I would not allow myself to
be labeled as autistic because it was associated with poor mental health.

Now I see that good traits and bad traits (strength and weakness) are really
two sides of the coin.  What if the extraordinary mental focus abilities come
at the cost of being able to know what another is thinking.

My entire adult life has been spent in the company of people very similar to
me, yet outliers for the society as a whole.  I'm pretty certain that 95% of
software developers would be classified as being on the autistic spectrum.

The may indeed be a requirement for the software industry.  People are drawn
to software because they can succeed without being penalized by there natural
ability to connect with others.  Obviously there are exceptions, but most 
developers I know are far more comfortable with hours on the computer instead
of hours spent with people. Maybe 1 of 20 are not that way. 


## Acceptance

I was first about 10 years old when I realized I was different from others.
I assumed that it was the result of living in Europe as a child. But it was 
far more than that.  My brain was wired to be different.  It was not a behavioral
issue but a biological one.

Over the years, I have worked hard to adopt behaviors that would allow me to
connect with others.  But I have always been fighting a biological imperative.
I have learned how to get along with others and sometimes I listen well. But
it takes a huge mental and emotional toll.  People drain me and soon I need to
disengage and seek solitude.

My son, Josiah, first helped me see the truth about how I think.  He started
talking about autism as if it was OK and I was quite surprised. He is much like
me only more so.  After studying this issue and pondering my life so far I came
to the startling understanding that much of the discomfort that I have 
experienced as an adult is related to autism.

This understanding came 50 years too late.  
For the first time I have language to describe my thinking patterns, social 
dynamics, and behavior tendencies. It has been difficult to admit the truth, but
I am now owning it.
