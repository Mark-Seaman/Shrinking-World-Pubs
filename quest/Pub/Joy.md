# A Journey into Joy

The journey into joy was one I never anticipated. For months, I had been defined by my
grief, feeling as though I had become a “grief walker.” All my relationships, all my conversations seemed to orbit
around this central loss, and while I was healing, I found myself yearning for more. I longed for a life that wasn’t
solely marked by sorrow — a life with friends, hobbies, laughter, and conversations unshadowed by grief. I wanted to
rediscover the things that had once brought me joy: teaching, writing, creating.

Life has taught me that joy is rooted in three essential pillars: creation, connection, and enjoyment. These pillars
guide my daily life, shaping how I approach every new day. Through them, I find purpose, vitality, and fulfillment.

The creative impulse is, perhaps, my most potent driver. It serves as both a foundation for my identity and a wellspring
of well-being. My creative outlets — writing, teaching, and innovating—are all ways I engage with the world. When I write,
I seek to unravel the layers of life and deepen my understanding of the world around me. My teaching, particularly in
technology, encompasses web applications, software engineering, and leveraging AI to solve everyday problems.
Innovation, meanwhile, is my way of making life simpler for myself and others, often by designing tools that enhance
efficiency and ease. Creating in these various forms brings profound joy and satisfaction, sustaining my sense of
purpose and vitality.

Connection with others is another cornerstone of my joy. As an introvert, building relationships has always been a
gradual process. I often hesitate with new acquaintances, needing time to build trust before I can fully relax into a
relationship. Yet, paradoxically, I have a deep need for connection. I value a few close friends, many of whom have been
a part of my life for decades. Family, old friends, and my church community are invaluable to me, forming a network that
nurtures, sustains, and grounds me. In connecting with others, I find a sense of belonging that brings warmth and
comfort to my life.

Finally, enjoyment is how I experience the richness of life. Emotional health, intellectual curiosity, and simple
pleasures like music, reading, and walking in nature all contribute to this dimension of joy. I also play guitar and
enjoy immersing myself in nature’s beauty. And then there’s travel — a passion that has taken me to over 30 countries.
Travel, for me, is more than just seeing new places; it’s about immersing myself in different cultures and broadening my
perspective. Each trip adds layers of depth to my life, reminding me of the beauty and diversity of our world.

## A Ghost of My Former Life

The loss of Stacie, my beloved wife, thrust me into an extended period of profound grief. I embarked on a long, arduous
journey of recovery, and over nine months, aspects of my life began to fall back into place. Socially, I re-engaged,
starting to rebuild the connections that had been dormant in the shadow of loss. Yet, as I tried to move forward, I was
acutely aware that I was merely a ghost of my former self. For a time, every aspect that brought me joy felt stripped
away. I was left with fragments of my old life, reminders of what once was.

Eventually, my desire to create rekindled. I returned to teaching at the University of Northern Colorado, started
publishing online again, and resumed building software. But my motivation was far from its former peak. Though I was
functioning, the vitality and enthusiasm that once drove my work were diminished. Socially, I was engaging almost daily
with friends, often having deep, meaningful conversations. But these interactions often revolved around my grief. Many
of my friends had become caregivers in my journey, and I was defined by my identity as a grief-stricken soul. I craved
friendships where my history of loss didn’t define me, relationships focused on shared interests, hobbies, and laughter.
This shift, however, seemed out of reach.

Enjoyment, too, had become a challenge. Entertainment became a coping mechanism, a way to numb the ache and pass the
time until healing took hold. I watched movies and read books, seeking distraction over joy. Travel, which had once been
a passion, was now tainted by loneliness; the thought of exploring new places alone no longer held the same appeal. It
was a shadowed existence, where creativity, connection, and enjoyment were merely echoes of what they had once been.

## Travels to Greece

In September, an opportunity arose that brought a glimmer of hope. Some old friends mentioned a trip they were taking to
Greece, retracing the apostle Paul’s journey — a journey similar to one Stacie and I had taken 25 years earlier. It seemed
like the perfect chance to meet people in a similar life stage and perhaps find future travel companions. So, I signed
up, hoping this journey might rekindle a spark in my life.

What I longed for was a restoration of joy. I yearned to reimagine my creative life, rediscover the richness of my
social life, and reignite my passion for living fully. I wasn’t entirely sure how this would unfold, but I believed that
being around a new group of people in a new setting might offer a fresh perspective. I approached the trip with modest
expectations, hoping at best to find some companions for future travels. Little did I know, this experience would be
transformative in ways I couldn’t have foreseen.

## My New Life

Each day in Greece, I felt a stirring within me. Surrounded by people who shared similar values, I found myself
rediscovering the creative impulses that had lain dormant. Ideas for books and poems emerged, and for the first time in
years, I felt inspired to pick up my guitar again. I began to imagine future travels and the kind of people I’d want to
share these adventures with. I had stumbled into a community of people who valued flexibility, adventure, and
connection. I felt as if I’d found my people, and with them, a vision of the life I wanted to lead.

Slowly but surely, each element of joy that had been missing from my life began to reawaken. It was as if a divine force
was breathing new life into me. I was reminded that creation, connection, and enjoyment were not only possible — they
were vital, life-giving forces I could reclaim. The grief that had once dominated my interactions and clouded my days
began to give way to new dreams and hopes. Tears still came, but they were now tears of gratitude and joy for the life I
felt myself returning to.

Looking back, that trip may have been the most transformative week of my life. It reawakened the core pillars of my
existence. Creating, connecting, and enjoying life became more than distant memories — they were once again realities. My
heart overflowed with new possibilities and fresh enthusiasm. I was stepping out of the shadows, embracing a future that
was rich with potential and filled with the kind of joy I had once thought was forever lost.

The journey wasn’t just a restoration of my former self; it was the beginning of a new chapter. One filled with
creativity, connection, and the promise of a life well-lived. I had found my way back to joy, and in doing so, I had
found myself again. The grief was still there, but it no longer defined me. 

This journey reignited my passions, reminding me that while my story has shifted, it hasn’t ended. There are still pages
left to be written, still adventures to embark upon. The journey into joy wasn’t just a trip to Greece; it was a
homecoming to myself, a rediscovery of the man I once was, and a hopeful step toward the man I am still becoming. 

In these journeys of the heart, I’ve found strength, connection, and perhaps most unexpectedly, joy. Life will never be
the same, but I am learning that maybe, just maybe, it can be beautiful again in a new way.
