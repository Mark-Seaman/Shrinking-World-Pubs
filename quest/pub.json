    "description": "After a lifetime of trying to find meaning in life I finally feel ready to share what I've learned. Why do I exist?  This is the question that I have grappled with for decades. \nEarly on, I knew that there must be some higher purpose for my existence.  In my\nteen years, I embraced easy and trite answers that others told me were true.\n\nBut these simple answers to my life purpose never seemed complete and left me\nwanting  a much fuller explanation.  Over the five decades since I have toyed\nwith many explanations before settling on the one you will read about here. \nAfter actively seeking for the meaning of life I believe that I now understand\nsome truths  well enough to share with others.\n\nThe is a record of my journey of personal understanding.   It is a long time in\nthe making.  I started my journey seeking enlightenment at age 13, and at age 60\nfinally had the breakthrough that I had been seeking most of my life.  ",
