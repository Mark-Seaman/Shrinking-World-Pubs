# Thought Leaders

There are people that have altered my thinking on a variety of topics. These thought leaders have ideas worth sharing
and promoting. In an age of the misinformation and intellectutal manipulation some stand out as examples to emulate and
follow. They speak with forcefulness and clarity. 

They are not afraid to speak truth to power. They are not afraid to challenge the status quo. They are not afraid to be
wrong. They are not afraid to be right. They are not afraid to be different. They are not afraid to be themselves. They
are not afraid to be human. They are not afraid to be vulnerable.

The world would be remarkably better if they were in control and could implement their ideas. They are not perfect, but
they are better than the alternatives. I seek to learn from them and promote their ideas to others. I seek to be a
thought leader myself. May my efforts contribute to an improved world for all.

the voices of those who have demonstrated a remarkable understanding of the world. I will be posting the collective 


Here I will be posting the collective wisdom of those people who have demonstrated a remarkable understanding of the world and can articulate it in a way that is understandable and actionable.

Those still living are the most relevant, but those who have passed on still have much to contribute. I will be posting what I have learned from them and how it has impacted my life.  I will be sharing their ideas as they would if they could speak to us today.
