# On Love and Loss

## Lifelong Love

Some wise man said that it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  I always understood this
to mean that even a short fling that ends badly is still better than nothing.  But I've recently been pondering a new
idea around this quote.

A love that grows over decades threatens to destroy the lover when it is no more.  How can one ever be whole again when
they are reduced to a small part of what they once were?  Is it worth the risk to love so deeply.

Love that lasts a lifetime is quite rare and precious.  It does not and cannot form overnight.  It requires the crucible
of life to bake it.  It needs hundreds of disagreements, comprises, recommitments and forgiveness to let it ripen.


## True Love

There is a popular notion of soulmates.  That there is one person out there that is perfect for you.  That you will
recognize them when you meet them.  That you will live happily ever after.  This is a nice idea, but it is not true.

Choosing to love someone is a decision.  It is not a feeling or a reaction.  It is a choice to put someone else's needs
above your own.  It is a choice to be vulnerable and to be honest.  It is a choice to be faithful and to forgive.  

Choosing to love is a starting point but not the end.  We must learn how to love well. This requires practice and many
failures.  It requires humility and a willingness to learn and try one more time.  

It is not a guarantee of happiness.  But true happiness cannot be found without it.  It is the only path to true life
with another person.  It is the only way to find true joy and peace.  

True love requires a death of sorts.  We must transition our thinking to change from "Me" to "We".  As we die to ourselves, 
we live for another.  Love is the only way to find true life.  


## Embrace Weakness

To some love is a sign of weakness. Vulnerability means that you can be hurt and that you are not in control.  Those people
seek to dominate and control others.  They are afraid of being hurt and so they hurt others first.  They are afraid that if
they are not in control, they will be controlled.  They are afraid of being weak and so they seek to dominate others.

Submission and dominance live in opposing worlds and do not mix.  Submission is a choice to give up control, while dominance
seeks to take control from others.  Those who seek to dominate others are not capable of love.  

Love demands humility and vulnerability.  It requires a willingness to be hurt and to forgive.  If you cannot risk being
hurt, you cannot love.  Forgiveness lies at the heart of true love.

Love is both totally natural and inexplicably unnatural at the same time.  It is the most natural thing in the world to
love those who love you.  But it is the most unnatural thing in the world to love your enemies.  Loving well is a skill
that must be learned over a lifetime.  It is a choice that must be made over and over again.


## Growth

Love Shapes our life in profound ways. It can reduce us to idiots or turn us into heroes.  It changes us at the core.  It gives us purpose and meaning.  

When I compare myself to others of similar circustances and temperment, I see that I have been shaped by love in ways
that they have not.  This has made me a better person and changed me at the very core.  It has made me more
compassionate and more forgiving.  It has given me a resilience that I would not have otherwise.  

I have been shaped by love in ways that I do not fully understand.  I have been in love since I was 15 years old.  It has
not always been easy or fun.  But it has always been worth it.  I am completely different than I would have been without
her in my life.

Stacie has called me out, talked me down, and lifted me up.  She has been my biggest fan and my frequent critic.  She has
always been there for me.  


## Fear of Loss

The depth of loss is related to the depth of love. The more you love, the more you have to lose. 

A lifetime of shared memories and experiences is a lot to lose. For couple who love this deeply, the loss of one is
a major fear that is always there.  

We truly have a shared mind.  So much so, that our kids refuse to play games with us.  We can read each other's minds
and finish each other's sentences.  We have a shared history and a shared future.  We have a single shared mind and that
is a loss beyond words.

Our common frame of reference and context include:

* 50 years of shared experiences
* relationships with family and friends
* movies, books, music, and events
* controversies and debates
* inside jokes and shared memories
* goals and dreams
* frustrations and disappointments
* crazy people we've had to deal with
* travels and adventures
* children and grandchildren
* financial struggles and successes

To lose one of us is to lose all of this.  It is a loss beyond words.  


## Risk

The unthinkable will eventually happen.  One of us will die before the other, unless we die in a car crash on I-25.  
This is a certainty that brings with it unbearable pain for one of us.  

Despite the great loss that may occur someday I have an unimaginable gratitude for the precious gift of love that we
have had. I have known hundreds of people fairly well. There is no one else that I would wish to trade places with.
Stacie and I have been blessed beyond measure.

I think that if I were to have five lifetimes, that I could never be so lucky again.  For the last 49 years, she has 
been the love of my life.  I have been blessed far beyond deserve.  I am grateful for each day that we have. Together
we have built an extraordinary life.

Is is better to love and lose?  For me the answer is a resounding yes.  I would not trade a single day of our life
together just to avoid the pain of loss.  When the road ends and we must part I will have no regrets.  My love is 
my reason for living.  That can never be taken away!
