# quest for understanding

## Private Understanding

I often don't understand how others think.  
If I'm honest I don't even know why I think the way I do.
This has become the most important aspect in my personal journey.
From an early age I embraced the idea of lifelong learning.
By the time I turned 60 I realized that learning is my career and sometimes I produce results for others.

This quest for understanding starts with a deep desire to know things that few others know.  I love a good puzzle and would go to extreme measures to figure them out.  My greatest personal and professional joy comes from solving puzzles and learning new skills.  

I've probably read over 2000 books. With about half of them being non-fiction.   People confound me. So I read a lot of social psychology in hopes of understanding myself and others.  I have built an extensive library and have eidetic memory that allows me to recall the exact location of things I've read.

I try to spend about 10 hours every week (10% of my waking time) to learn and grow and perhaps another 10 hours to learn skills related to my work projects.

I cannot imagine a life without learning.


## Public Understanding


Having the answers to questions that might help others creates a desire within me to share these insights. I often feel like a beggar telling his friends where to find bread.  A truth known is a truth to share.  I feel this desire in every area of life.

This has both a light and a dark side.  The good part is the desire to teach and share my knowlegde and wisdom.  The bad side is my desire to control others.

Influence is gated by the desire of others to accept my input.  This has always been a sore spot with me, both in private relationships and the marketplace in general.  I have many opinions about everything that are often shared with those I related to.

Often these ideas are not welcome and I get frustrated with the other person.  My base instinct is to push harder to convince them of my correctness, but this can easily poison the relationship.  As I have aged, I have tried to resist becoming the grumpy old man that is arrogant and angry about the direction of the world.

I have learned to accept my limited influence and respect the autonomy of others. This allow me to be at peace with others that do not act on my advice. I have learned to release the desire to control what others do, say, think, or feel.  I can have some limited influence but never control.

In the past years I felt that it was my duty to make the world better.  Now I see that my primary job is to control myself and manage what I do, say, think, and feel.  The world will have to care for itself.  

My responsibility ends with my control.  I cannot fix ignorance, prejudice, violence, poverty, politics, hatred, sickness and fanaticism in others.  But I can address those issues in my life.  I find that it is no small task.
