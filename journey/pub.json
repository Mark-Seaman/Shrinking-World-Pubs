    "description": "Humans Tell Stories\n\nStory telling is fundamental to the human experience. Stories are intended to impact both the intellect and the emotions. Stories call people to take action because behavior is controlled by our emotions.\n\nWe can all relate to the feeling of knowing what we must do but feeling powerless to do it for lack of motivation. Once the emotions are stirred then we find the will to do what is needed. Feelings are the fire that drives the engine.\n\nWe like to believe that humans are rational beings that emote, but in reality we are emotional beings that rationalize. Emotions always drive behavior, and the intellect attempts to come up with a decent rationalization.\n\nA great story motivates and guides by engaging both the heart and the head. While the intellect may guide us in the right direction, it is necessary to touch the emotions to get us to move.",
