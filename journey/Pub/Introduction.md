# Introduction

## Meaning of Life


Why do I exist?  This is the question that I have grappled with for decades. 
Early on, I knew that there must be some higher purpose for my existence.  In my
teen years, I embraced easy and trite answers that others told me were true.

But these simple answers to my life purpose never seemed complete and left me
wanting  a much fuller explanation.  Over the five decades since I have toyed
with many explanations before settling on the one you will read about here. 
After actively seeking for the meaning of life I believe that I now understand
some truths  well enough to share with others.

The is a record of my journey of personal understanding.   It is a long time in
the making.  I started my journey seeking enlightenment at age 13, and at age 60
finally had the breakthrough that I had been seeking most of my life.  

To  truly understand this journey I will tell a series of stories from places
I've been and people that I met along the way.  Each of these stories taught me
something about the mysteries of life and shaped my thinking in important ways. 
It can be said that we are largely the products of the experiences that we have
had and the meaning that we assign to them.



## Seasons of Life


One key understanding I've developed is that life happens in a series of
seasons.  Each season has its own unique challenges and joys.  Each season of
life offers its own goals and objectives that must be fulfilled.  Success in
each season does not look much like that of the adjacent seasons.  

Each life stage comes with its own quest.  Success in Youth has little
relationship to success in the Young Adult phase of life.  The primary quest
during Old Age does not much resemble the objectives of Mid-life.  This means
that the meaning of life changes with each life stage that you experience.

To verify that this is true reflect on your own life experience.  Think about
the fundamental questions of meaning that drove your life when you were young. 
Think about how different your life is today.  The quest that drove you then has
little bearing on how you feel today.



## Areas of Life


A second key understanding that I've developed is that fulfillment has several
dimensions.  In order to feel successful it is the combination of success in
different areas of life.  Some people succeed in family life while having little
success at work.  It also happens in reverse.  But for me to be fulfilled I must
have meaningful work and meaningful relationships. In addition I must be
constantly growing as a person and having fun while doing it.

Success is making the most of what you are given.  Fulfillment requires being
successful at all of the major areas of life.  For the last ten years I have
organized my life objectives into four main areas.  Each of these areas required
concerted effort to development them in healthy ways.  Failing in one of these
areas means that I will have failed in my life as a whole.

- **Work** - how I use my strengths to contribute and make a living
- **Love** - how I build meaningful relationship and connect with others
- **Growth** - how I learn and grow over my lifetime
- **Fun** - how I experience life on a daily basis



## Before I Existed


The world existed long before me, and I hope that it will exist long after I am
gone.  I am here for a time to live out my destiny among others that are also
trying to live out their hopes and dreams.

I was born into specific circumstances and these details act as constraints on
what I can do in my life.  Consider the impact of the following details for your
life.  Think about the natural constraints that they impose on your life
opportunities.

- **Time** - I was born late in the Baby-boom period after WWII.  This was a time of 
unprecedented events and struggles and opportunities.
- **Place** - I was born in America which is the richest and most powerful nation on 
earth.
- **Culture** - I am deeply indoctrinated as an American.  This something that I 
consider both good and bad.
- **Parents** - The genetics, life experiences, and character of my parents 
influenced me greatly.
- **Ancestry tree** - I come from a long line of ancestors that have imprinted 
their legacy (both good and bad) onto me.

The context of our birth largely defines the life that we can live.  We make
choices to develop our live along certain paths but these choices are severely
limited by the circumstances of our birth.  I grew up as a male boomer in the US
born to middle class protestant parents.  This gave me a very different life
than someone who was born as a Jordanian  woman in 1939 or a Congolese man in
1900.  Our lives  would be nothing alike.

Because our choices are limited by things outside our control we know that the
more different the circumstances are between two people the more different their
lives will be.  But when considering people with very similar life circumstances
there is a huge difference in life paths based on the choices that people make. 
Life choices can make a profound difference but are still a second-order effect.



## Destiny


I believe in destiny.  But not like some do - as some sort of pre-destined fate.
Life is like a game of chess.  There are many moves that are possible, but most
moves don't make any sense.  A beginner will often make bad moves and quickly
lose the game.   A Grand Master will only play moves that are consistent with
the successful outcome of the game.  My understanding of destiny is much more
like this. Walking out your destiny is playing the best moves possible, given
the constraints.

Two different people will always have different constraints limiting their
movements. So they will naturally produce differing outcomes while each
fulfilling their destiny.  I believe that Destiny is the Game of Life well
played!   Let it be said of my life that I made the most of what I was given.

Success in life does not require that you succeed in everything you do.
It is more related to how well you played the game.
