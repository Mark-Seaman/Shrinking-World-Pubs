# When the World Burned

## Political Turmoil

The year was 2020 when the world caught fire.  Nationalistic movements in many countries threatened
to plunge the entire globe into the final great war.  The beating of drums could be heard in most
countries as authoritarian dictators strutted their stuff in a way not seen since Hitler.

Even in America, once a beacon of democracy, there was serious debate about whether we were
witnessing the last gasp of free elections.  By the start of 2020 fear and anger had poisoned both
public and private social interactions.  Relationships that had been treasured for decades were
cast aside because hatred was running hot just below the surface.


## Climate Change

2020 was also the hottest year in recorded history.  Climate change had become a political topic
rather than a scientific issue.  Much of the public had been taught to ignore the changing weather
conditions despite any fact presented.  2020 saw significant new climate catastrophes continuing
the building trend.

The year was marked by unprecedented hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, and floods.  As I write we
have days when we cannot be outside because of the smoke from the fires.  The whole western US is
on fire.

The cause of the changing climate can be debated, but only an absolute idiot would deny it.  Each
serious issue we face has become mired in politics and uninformed opinions. We no longer really
believe in science or any other form of objective reality.  We believe that perception creates its
own reality so that everyone's opinion is equally valid.


## Pandemic

March 13, 2020 was the day the pandemic hit my world.  I knew within a week that my world would
never be the same.  I was teaching at the university and there was an immediate shutdown.  Soon
some of our leaders would realize how serious the situation was.  The governor of Colorado ordered
everyone to shelter in place and a complete shutdown of all normal aspects of social life.

Because of the extreme foolishness and incompetency of President Trump, the containment of the
epidemic failed spectacularly.  This resulted in the US leading the worldwide death toll by a huge
margin. Once again we saw the pain caused by failing leadership.

Other countries responded in different ways to the crisis and many were able to soften the impact of
the pandemic.  Like the climate crisis, those in power turned the pandemic into a political issue
rather than a scientific one.  Denial persisted even as the President himself got infected.
Eventually, almost everyone would become infected with COVID.


## Inequity and Injustice

From 2016 on, there has been a steady erosion of personal freedom.  The crackdown on immigration and
the imprisonment of the children of immigrants is deeply rooted in ethnic hatred and bigotry that
is quite old.  But it has rarely been the policy of the US government to be so heartless toward
those who suffer.

Violence and brutality have hit an all-time level.  The murder of George Floyd by policemen sparked
a new fire.  Police forces enforce the rule of law and seek to uphold justice.  But justice has not
been available equally to all.  Protection has been given largely to the privileged and denied to
the poor and minorities. 

America has become a land of "Haves and Have Nots‚Äù. Wealth and power are integrally connected.
America has been great in the past precisely because there was a large middle class.  Wealth and
power are consolidated before like no other time in our history.  1% of the people own 50% of the
wealth.  5 individuals control the wealth of the poorest 50% of all Americans.  Ponder that for a
moment.

Social justice is directly tied to the sharing of wealth and power.  The murder of George was seen
by many to represent the oppressors attacking their victims in an attempt to teach them their
place.  Racism and bigotry are often wrapped in language about law and order.  This fire has been
burning since the inception of this nation.  But in 2020 it threatened to erupt and engulf us all.
