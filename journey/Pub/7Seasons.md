# Through Seven Seasons

Stacie and I journeyed through every season of life together, our bond strengthening with each passing year. Even if I
lived three lifetimes, I could never expect to find such happiness.

**Childhood**  

We first met in sixth grade at the age of 11, forced to share a desk. Stacie was incredibly annoying, and we constantly
fought over space, even getting sent to the principalâ€™s office once.

**Teen Years**  

We both joined a church youth group, and sparks began to fly. In the midst of our teenage struggles, we found solace in
each other. However, life events separated us. Stacie had back surgery and was bedridden for six months. After her
father's death, her mother remarried, and they moved to South Dakota, ending our relationship.

**Our 20s**  

We reunited and got married at 19, stepping into adulthood together. The next decade was filled with the demands of
parenthood and career-building. During this time, we made crucial decisions about raising our children, managing
finances, and planning our careers. It was a pivotal period in our lives.

**Our 30s**  

As our children became teenagers, we entered a new era of parenting. This phase required us to understand and respect
our children's individuality. We also began to understand ourselves on a deeper level, which was essential to manage the
increasing demands on our time and energy.

**Our 40s**  

In our 40s, we sought purpose beyond parenthood as our children left the nest. Together, we faced the inevitable
disillusionments and disappointments of this stage of life, striving to find new meaning and direction.

**Our 50s**  

Our 50s were characterized by leadership and influence. We aimed to have a positive impact on those around us and the
organizations we served. Our focus shifted to making the world a better place through our contributions to our kids,
professions, church, and community.

**Our 60s**  

Turning 60 marked a significant change. Our lives transitioned from doing to being. As grandparents, our physical and
emotional limitations required us to adapt. We embraced our new roles as advisors rather than leaders, offering help
instead of taking charge.

**Every Decade**  

Looking back at our lives, I am amazed that Stacie and I have known each other through all seven stages of life. From
childhood to old age, we experienced heartbreaking pain and unbelievable joy together. She was my lover, confidant, best
friend, teacher, and constant companion. And I was hers! Even if I lived three lifetimes, I could never expect to find
such happiness.
