# My Return to Classroom Teaching

## Unexpected Return to Teaching

Today marks my unexpected return to the classroom, following my retirement from the University of Northern Colorado
(UNC) last December after seven years of teaching. At UNC’s Monfort College of Business, I had the privilege of leading
courses in Web Development and Software Engineering. Retirement felt right at the time, as I was eager to focus on
building my Shrinking World Academy, an online school that would expand on the work I had done in academia.

Before retiring, I worked closely with UNC to transition my courses, handing over the materials I had developed,
including three textbooks and fully designed curricula for three highly successful classes. It was deeply satisfying to
know I had made a lasting impact on the students and had laid the groundwork for future instructors.

This fall was the first semester that Intermediate Web Development class was taught by someone else. I was prepared to embrace my
new life of leisure, but fate had other plans. On Labor Day, just one week into the new semester, I received shocking
news: the professor who had taken over my class had passed away unexpectedly. With the students already immersed in
their first week, there was an urgent need to step in and ensure their education continued seamlessly. 

Now, I'm back in front of a familiar classroom, ready to guide these students through the rest of the semester — a return
I hadn’t anticipated, but one that feels like the right thing to do.  Now the challenge was to take the reins and lead the 
students through the rest of the semester. I was excited to see several students from the class I had previously taught on software engineering. 

## Preparing for Class

It was early on Labor Day morning, when I first received the news. A text message informed me of the tragic
passing of the professor who had taken over my Web Development class. By the next morning, I had accepted the unexpected
challenge of stepping back into the classroom to ensure the students' learning experience continued without disruption.

Tuesday was a whirlwind of preparation. I needed to get everything in place for the Wednesday afternoon class. UNC uses
Canvas, a learning management system that stores all the course materials, assignments, the grade book, and provides a
communication platform between teachers and students. The system requires significant setup, but thankfully, I had
taught this course last fall. This allowed me to accelerate the process by importing all the materials from the previous
semester, saving me valuable time. 

The next hurdle was adjusting the curriculum to fit the new timeline. I had to modify the syllabus, ensuring it aligned
with the current academic calendar and made sense for the students. I worked late into the night, making the necessary
adjustments so everything would be ready for Wednesday’s class.

When I finally met with the students, I explained the situation and presented the revised plan. We would effectively
restart the course from the beginning, just one week in. Fortunately, this only required resetting two class sessions. I
delayed the curriculum by a week and removed the final week's content, which was less essential for the students. 

## Course History

For seven years, I had the privilege of teaching BACS 350 at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC), a course that
quickly became the highlight of my teaching career. BACS 350, officially titled Business Administration - Computer
Science: Intermediate Web Development, was designed with a clear and ambitious goal: to equip every student with the
skills necessary to secure a job as a professional software developer. This was no small task for a single course, but
through years of refinement, I made it a reality.

Five years ago, I undertook the significant challenge of completely rewriting the course to incorporate the latest web
development technologies, building upon the work of my predecessor. This overhaul marked a turning point, and from that
moment on, I focused on optimizing the course year after year. I shifted towards a more practical, hands-on approach
that would empower students to apply what they learned in real-world scenarios. With each iteration, the course became
more effective, and I saw my students thrive in the fast-evolving world of web development.

BACS 350 became more than just a class — it was a launching pad for the next generation of developers. When I retired
from UNC, I was able to utilize the curriculum as one of the flagship offerings in my online school, Shrinking World
Academy. I hope that this course, which had evolved into a true gem over the years, continues to make an impact far
beyond the university walls.

This course took an enormous amount of effort to develop and refine, but the results were more than worth it. I was
finally able to achieve my goal of delivering highly valued skills to students without having to have a teacher present.
Everything is available online and students can watch videos, read the textbook, and get step by step instructions to
complete the 14 projects.  This is the crowning achievement of my teaching career.  I am so proud of what I have
accomplished. 

## Engaging with Students

Stepping back into the classroom, I was thrilled to see several familiar faces from my previous Software Engineering
course. These students were already familiar with my teaching style, and I quickly communicated the transition plan and
course objectives. Their positive response to the goals I had set for this Web Development course was reassuring and
invigorating.

One of the biggest challenges students face today is the gap between academic theory and real-world, marketable skills.
Many college courses provide valuable background knowledge, but they often fall short in preparing students for
immediate professional opportunities. This class, however, is different. My focus has always been to ensure that every
student who succeeds in this course leaves with the skills necessary to be hired as a professional developer. Having run
a software business for 12 years, I designed the course with the mindset that I would be willing to hire any student who
excelled in it. Over the years, I optimized the curriculum to align with real-world demands and produce that very
result.

Looking back, I consider "Intermediate Web Development" the pinnacle of my teaching career. Nothing else I’ve done in
education feels as significant or impactful. When I retired, I didn’t anticipate how much I would miss the opportunity
to contribute to others' success. Returning to the classroom unexpectedly has rekindled that sense of purpose. While the
circumstances that brought me back were tragic, this opportunity to make a difference again feels like a true blessing,
one that I didn’t realize I needed.
