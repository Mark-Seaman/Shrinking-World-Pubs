# Conflict Over Integrity

My dad, Dave Seaman, began his teaching career at Asbury College in Kentucky. After earning his PhD, he was specifically
recruited by the college president, Dr. Johnson. However, the idyllic situation was short-lived. When President
Johnson retired, his successor, a fanatical leader, clashed with my dad's principles.

The new president's insistence on a flawless accreditation report led to a confrontation. "I couldn't lie on that report
as a Christian," my dad said firmly. "When I refused to revise it, he told me I wouldn't be teaching there the next
year."

Faced with this ultimatum, my dad didn't back down. He handed the president a copy of Eric Hoffer's *The True Believer*,
a bold move that symbolized his stand against the fanaticism he saw taking over the institution. This led to a letter
stating his contract wouldn't be renewed.

"I didn't go quietly," he added with a glint of defiance. "I reached out to supportive colleagues and friends, other
faculty members who saw the president's madness."

He directly told the president that they were prepared to sue and that they would win. A member of the Board of Trustees
took this seriously and confronted the president the next day. He informed the president that the Board had decided he
had to retract his letter. He even dictated the retraction letter, ensuring it was typed and signed by the president
himself. The letter stated that my dad was welcome to teach at Asbury College for as long as he liked. "I wish I had
saved that letter, but I think it's lost now," my dad reminisced.

My dad's bold stand against the presidentâ€™s integrity helped spark a movement within the college. He was also friends
with the students who ran the campus paper, and they decided to take matters into their own hands. They brought several
ethical breaches to light, and eventually, the president's deceit was exposed. A year later, they managed to oust him,
though he had to be evicted from the president's home by the sheriff.

As the drama unfolded, it became clear to my dad that he wanted to move on from a small religious college to a much
larger organization with more accountability and clear procedures. This realization set the stage for his future
endeavors and achievements for the rest of his career.
