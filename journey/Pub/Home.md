# Quest for Home

Finding my way back home should have been simple. Yet, after Stacie's passing, a deep yearning pulled me towards
rediscovering what "home" truly meant. I longed for normalcy, to reconnect with my roots, to reminisce about the places
and friendships of yesteryears that seemed lost in time. The search for this elusive concept became a journey that
spanned months, taking me across familiar and distant lands alike.

I began close to my current residence, within the embrace of my family and community. From there, I journeyed backward
through time, rekindling connections with faces unseen for decades—ten, twenty, thirty, even forty years. Each step took
me further afield, revisiting the locales that shaped my upbringing and early adulthood.

I often wandered around Greeley, Colorado where we raised our children, and Boise, Idaho, where my career in technology
began and our family house remains. Yet, it was Flagstaff, Arizona, where Stacie and I first met, fell in love, faced
trials, and eventually wed, that held a profound significance. It was here that our shared journey truly began, where
the essence of "home" was deeply rooted.

But amidst this odyssey, I discovered that "home" isn't merely a geographical place. It transcends physicality; it
embodies an ideal, an experience, a sanctuary of love and belonging. It resides in the tranquility of knowing things
will be alright, in the optimism that life's path will unfold as it should, and in the joy of embracing each moment with
gratitude. Above all, it dwells in the boundless love of those who surround us.

In Flagstaff, I found a piece of home, or rather the peace of home. Yet, I realized that home isn't confined to a single
location—it manifests wherever love and cherished memories thrive. And so, in the end, I found home not just in
Flagstaff, but in the heartwarming embrace of every time and place my journey led me.
