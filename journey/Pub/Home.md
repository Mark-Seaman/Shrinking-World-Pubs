# You Can't Go Home

They say you can't go home, and while this is partly true, my experience has shown it is not entirely the case. The
search for home often stems from a desire to recapture those moments of joy, peace, and hope we once had and to find
that place of safety and security and belonging. It is true that these moments cannot be perfectly replicated. As life
progresses, circumstances change, making it nearly impossible to recreate those past times of prosperity.

Part of being human is grappling with the reality that we can never truly return to a specific moment in time. Life is a
series of seasons, each bringing its own experiences. There are seasons of difficulty and seasons of tranquility and
peace—the moments we long to return to when we think of going home.

Recently, I've faced significant life changes, stirring a desire to turn back the clock to more peaceful and joyful
times. My wife's recent death has led me to reconsider what it means to live a deep and meaningful life. Her loss has
prompted me to reassess my beliefs, values, time, and even my basic identity.

In my 20s, I was certain about many aspects of life—how to live positively, succeed at work, raise children, and be a
good person or Christian. Now, in my 60s, these certainties have become rather murky. I find myself longing for the
clarity and certainty of youth.

Many sources offer false certainty, proposing doctrines and beliefs that claim to eliminate uncertainty. However, I find
that such claims often lack integrity. Life's mysteries are something to marvel at. There are truths I know but can't
fully explain, beliefs that are often contradictory and paradoxical.

At this stage of life, I've learned to appreciate the mystery, paradox, and irony, celebrating the idea that no one can
fully understand how the world works. We get glimpses and fleeting moments of clarity, but we often end up in a stance
of acceptance rather than certainty. We accept certain truths as factual, even without understanding all the details.
Life, indeed, is a mystery.

Returning to the idea of going home—is it possible to rediscover those earlier times of peace, joy, and hope? I believe
it is, and this is the essence of going home. I recently returned to Flagstaff, Arizona, where I grew up, met my wife,
fell in love, and became a Christian. This is where my worldview was shaped.

Visiting the places where these events occurred brought back a flood of memories. I remembered how it was but also
recognized that I could never truly return to that time and place. Although it had only been a year since my last visit
to Flagstaff, this time I walked the paths alone, acutely aware that my previous life was beyond reach.

There is a deep longing in every human heart—a sense of what makes life good, brings well-being, and peace. These things
are enduring. If we define home by what brings peace into our lives, we can indeed go home. It begins by understanding
the nature of home, hope, joy, and what we value most. Often, what we love is within our reach. We can go home, indeed.
