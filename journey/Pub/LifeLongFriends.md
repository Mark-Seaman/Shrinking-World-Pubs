# Lifelong Friends

Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting with friends I've known for nearly 50 years. Stacie and I first started dating
in high school, and we have friends that go all the way back to this time.  This recent visit has led me to reflect on
the marvels of long-term friendships.

While many relationships fade once the common point of interest disappears, some endure for decades. Family bonds, in
particular, tend to be more resilient because the shared history remains even when common interests wane.

During our twenties and early thirties Stacie and I were involved in church planting.  Many of our deep friendships date
back to this time. This period was filled with excitement, stress, and considerable conflict, yet from this volatile
time, we forged lasting relationships. Today, we remain close to about a dozen couples from that era.

Any relationship that lasts more than a decade is truly precious. It is something to be nurtured and not taken lightly. I
am so grateful for the many friends that we made.

After losing Stacie, these friendships became vitally important to me. They provided a means to discuss our shared
experiences with people who were deeply involved in a formative period of our lives. These enduring connections have
offered comfort and continuity, reinforcing the importance of lifelong friends.

These relationships allow me to truly celebrate our shared experiences. They are a reminder that we are not alone in our
struggles, and that we have people who care about us. We all need friends who have known us for decades, who have seen
us at our best and worst, and who still love us.
