# Bible Translation

Bible translation has affected my life since day one, literally.  When I was
born my Dad was in Norman, Oklahoma, studying linguistics.  He was working with
the Wycliffe Bible Translators, whose mission was to translate the scripture into
all the languages of the earth.


## John Wycliffe

I have always been fascinated by the stories of the radical movements throughout
history, that brought us the modern bible that we read today.  Many of these men
were
martyred as heretics for their opposition to the established authority.  

One of my favorite characters is John Wycliffe.  Born in the 1320s Wycliffe
survived the Black Death and faced a society that was dominated by an evil
church structure. The Dark Ages were ruled by a string of bad popes from
767-1534.  These men committed every atrocity forbidden by the 10 Commandments. 
In 1378 there were two popes ruling simultaneously and a third was added in
1409.

John Wycliffe was a priest in England that opposed the corruption of the ruling
leaders and the church of the time.  He became increasingly vocal about the
excesses of clergy and and the godlessness of the church.  He began translating
the scripture into English from Latin so that the common people could read it.

A council was convened in 1414 to select a single Pope.  They also declared John
Wycliffe and his follower Jan Hus in Prague heretics. Wycliffe had already died
but his body was exhumed and burned. Jan Hus was burned alive. All of their
followers were hunted and persecuted and many executed by being burned alive. 
Wycliffe's writings fueled the Reformation movement almost 100 years later.


## Cameron Townsend and the Holdstocks

In 1917 Cameron Townsend visited Guatemala to sell Spanish Bibles to the locals.
He found that most of the local people spoke  other native languages, rather than
Spanish. One
man even rebuked him when Cameron tried to sell him a Spanish Bible, "Why, if
your God is so smart, hasn't he  learned our language?".  On this challenge
Townsend founded Wycliffe Bible Translators, an organization dedicated to
translating the scripture into native languages.

In 1975, I met some Wycliffe missionaries that were working in northern Canada. 
Marshall and Jean Holdstock were working with an Indian tribe called the Beaver
people.  They described themselves as Pacifists & Anarchists.  They had moved to
the wilderness over 100 miles from any civilization to live a simple life.
Soon they met some native people there that helped them survive in "the bush".   
They began learning how to
communicate and learned their language. 

Winters were spent with the Beaver tribe and summers were spent in relative
comfort in a town of 100 people just 40 miles from a town of 10,000.  The long
winter nights were spent interacting with the locals and learning vocabulary and
grammar.  During the summer months they would begin converting the knowledge
into translation of the scriptures in the Beaver language.  

They had been at it for years when I met them and had completed the book of
John.  The book of Mark was next on the agenda.  I was able to talk with them
extensively about their work.  I was fascinated to learn about what motivated
them and also the technical details of producing an accurate translation of
scripture.

Marshall Holdstock taught me about how important it was to capture the original
meaning for each passage.  This involves understanding the historical, cultural,
and political context of the time in which it was written.  Then words are
chosen to reflect the true meaning of the passage to match the different context
of the Beaver people.  If Jesus were to visit the Beaver village this afternoon,
what would he say to them?


## Speaking the Common Language

Good bible translation requires transforming the words while preserving the
cultural meaning.
This is far different than the concept of linguistic accuracy that most people
seek out.   When God became a man, he was completely what we are, in every
respect.  He had our life, with all of its frustrations and heartbreak.  He spoke
our language and learned skills and how to get along with others.  Yet, in our
minds we see Jesus as a religious figure. But he was not.

The bible was not written with the religious and scholarly language of the day. 
That type of language was used for legal and educational purposes.  The language
of the bible is the language of streets, marketplace, and workplace. God meets
humans where they are at, coming down from a place of glory to become lowly in
order to close the gap.

It seems rather ridiculous to me, that groups would favor archaic translations of
scripture because they are seen as being more accurate.  This desire for
religious distance puts a barrier between us and true understanding of God's
truth.  Relevance of the concepts (and words that ring true in our hearts) are the
real test of accuracy.  While a word-for-word translation may seem accurate and
scholarly, it has little value in communicating truth.  God speaks to all people
in their native tongue.

Good translation provides an interpretation with the same literal, moral,
allegorical, and prophetic meaning that the original authors intended for their
audience. Hermeneutics is the fancy word that is used in Seminary for this
concept of cultural equivalence and relevance. It requires a deep understanding
of the context of the author:  History, Culture, Language, Worldview.
