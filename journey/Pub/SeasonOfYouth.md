# Season of Youth

## Seasons of Life

There are four major seasons of life.  Each of these have fundamentally different
challenges and opportunities.   The season is inevitable because our lives are
not static but constantly changing.

As life changes, so do all of the details that affect our daily living.  Just as
the weather patterns change in predictable ways, our experience will follow
predictable patterns.  These seasons of life must be understood in order to 
adapt properly to them.

Read the article entitled "[Seasons of Life](Seasons)" to get a general overview.


## Spring Season  - Youth (ages 0-20)


The first two decades we experience rapid change that will shape the rest of our
lives.  The first decade is our childhood which teaches us about the world our
parents can from.  The second decade is where we must push beyond the
understanding from our parents to form our own unique identity.

Childhood is built around the programming of our parents and teachers.  They
have desires for our lives, for better or worse.  We are born into a world that
we did not create and have little influence over it.  Our childhood is largely
shaped by the choices of others. We live in our parent's world.

During our teen years we must learn to live a life separate from our parents. 
There must be a gradual and often painful transition between the identity that
we inherit from our parents to one which is forged in the school of hard knocks.
 Every child must rebuild their identity before they can become an adult.

This is a painful process for both the parent and child, because it must involve
conflict.  Everything is at stake and tensions run high.  Many parents are
uncomfortable with conflict create an atmosphere of denial.  Other parents seek
to reassert their dominance over the decisions of their children.  This can
undermine the progress toward establishing an independent identity for the child
and cost years of delay in becoming a happy adult.

Both the childhood and teen years are crucial in shaping a healthy identity. 
This process is never perfect and there are always lingering failures and
regrets that cause problems later.  For both parent and child, it is important
to work through the forgiveness of wounds resulting from the transition.   We
must recognize that this is a key part of being human and that we can move
forward no matter what has happened in the past.


## Quest for Belonging


Each season of life is governed by a primary quest, which represents deep
questions of meaning.  Both children and teen are consumed by one big question
with other more detailed questions attached.

- Who am I and how do I fit?
    - What can I do?   
    - Am I loved?
    - What brings joy?
    - Who are my people?
    - What do I value and believe?

The Quest for Belonging is a journey that starts at birth and continues until
this question is fully answered.  This is not an easy thing and for most people
and will require about twenty years.

During childhood we are told by parents and teachers who we are and how we fit
in the world.  But as teens we must reevaluate this identity and reassess the
truths that have been given to us by others.

It is not until after we have reforged a working identity that we can fully
enjoy adult life. For some, this doesn't happen until they are well into their
thirties causing significant problems in their lives.


## Discovery of Self


The Quest for Belonging is a journey of self-discovery leading to
self-awareness.  Only by learning who I am can I be ready to understand how I
fit into the world around me.  

Experiencing love is an essential part of this journey because it give us
courage to face the hard truths about themselves.  Children without loving
parent are often delayed in understanding who they are and how they fit in.

Our beliefs and values are largely set during the season of youth.  Our life
experiences and the meaning that we assign to the events shape us in ways we are
mostly unaware of.  Lies we believe can create a false identity that plagues us
for decades.

The goals that we have for our lives flow directly from our beliefs and values. 
Our values drive what goals we pursue and our beliefs inform the strategy we use
to get them.


## Challenges

Every quest has challenges that must be overcome.  Common challenges during the
Quest for Belonging include ...

- Feeling of rejection, abandonment, and conditional love
- Descent into selfishness and care only about my needs
- Life dreams can be squashed and leave us without hope

quest end with a clear understanding of ...

- Personal capabilities including: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
