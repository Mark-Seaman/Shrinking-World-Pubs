# UNC Retirement

I am excited to announce my retirement from UNC.
Seven years ago I started teaching in the Monfort Business College at University of Northern Colorado.  After decades of experience in high tech I was eager to train students in the skills that were often missing in newly graduated engineers that I had hired.  

## UNC Revenue

During my seven-years at UNC, I had the privilege of training 433 students, delivering a total of 1,300 credit hours. The translates into supporting a revenue of  $2.6 million for UNC (assuming a rate of $2,000 per credit hour. 

## Courses Created

I built the following courses to teach students the skills they will need to thrive in the tech industry.

- Introduction to Web Development with HTML and CSS
- Intermediate Web Development with Python, Django and PostGRES
- Software Engineering Skills - a project based approach

Creating a course requires about 1,000 hours of effort, according to my logs.  These courses required an aproximately 3,000 hours. 

## Classroom Teaching

Additionally, I taught 17 sections, which encompassed classroom facetime, lesson preparation, grading, and ongoing communication with students. Each section demanded an average of 150-250 hours of my time, resulting in a total commitment of 2,600-4,250 hours.

Combining the course preparation with classroom effort, comes to an overall investment of around  6,000-7,000 hours over my seven-year journey as an adjunct professor.

## Dynamics of Teaching

My time at UNC has given me a lot of insight into the current state of higher education.  I was able to directly observe the progress of learning and am now able to craft materials to move students at an optimal rate.

I have developed techniques for project and team based learning that I will be applying to my courses at Shrinking World.  I have also gained an appreciation for how learning activities must be divided into smaller units of skills that can be aggregated.  This knowledge will be used to give students an optimal learning experience.

## Future Plans

My time will be spent continuing to build Shrinking World, a software and training company that I founded in 2007 after retiring from HP.  This has been relatively dormant during my time at UNC.

I've written three textbooks and three online courses.  I look forward to writing additional textbooks and building more courses.

My current passions lie in teaching skills that will allow people to thrive in the modern world.  This includes software development process and technology, and using generative AI to build courses and write.   I am currently working on several Seminars (1 hour of video) and Workshops (4 hours of video) on these subjects.   I hope to create a Seminar each month and a Workshop each quarter.

My time at UNC has been both formative and informative.  I now hope to leverage that insight to serve a much broader audience.
