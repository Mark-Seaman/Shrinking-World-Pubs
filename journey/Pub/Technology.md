# Shaped by Technology

## Key Role of Technology

Technology has shaped my entire adult life.  It is hard to contemplate what my
life would be like apart from it. My entire working career was spent in roles
related to computer engineering and most of my hobbies are hosted on computers
of one sort or another.

I love gadgets and appreciate superior design in any product, but especially in
computer hardware and software. For me, technology represents one of the highest
forms of creative problem solving.

I love creating software because it is the one domain in which I can create a
world where I am in total control of every detail. If I don't like what is
happening I can change it to be exactly what I wish for.

Technology also represents my interface to the world. With a computer I can
interact with people across the globe and have meaningful collaborations with
others that I may seldom meet face-to-face.


## Change Over Time

Each decade for the last fifty years has brought a wave of  innovation.  Each
wave built on what existed before but also fundamentally extended the reach of
technology into our everyday lives.  

Let's look at the large movements of technology  throughout the decades from the
80s to the current time. Each decade was centered around several breakthrough
products that changed the world. Had any of the these products not been
introduced then the history would have been significantly different than it was.


## Time Invested

From the time I was 18, I have either been in school or been working with computers. 
This has been the one constant throughout my life.  A work life of 40-50
hours/week represents 40-50% of the waking hours.  With another investment for
hobbies of 10-20 hours weekly, it is easy to claim that I have spent at least 60% of
my life in front of a computer.

Computers are clearly the dominate force in my adult life.  For better or worse,
my life has been structured around the computer systems.  For the most part, it
has been a very rewarding experience.  I am well-suited to thrive in a world 
populated by machines.  But there are limits to this world and consequences for
those who cannot exist without  the technology.


## Breakthroughs by Decade

To better understand this technology affects our lives today we need to go
back to the early 1980s. We will be touring each decade and looking at the key
changes that occurred in order to see the world that exists today.  Nothing
happens in isolation and everything is connected.
