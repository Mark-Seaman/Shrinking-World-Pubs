# Bag of Potatoes

Billy crouched on the running boards of the train as it raced through the 
country side. He did not have enough money to get a ticket for the inside. He
was on a terribly important mission. The very survival of his family was at
stake.

The war was over now but the true struggle had just started.  Most of the people
in Berlin lived in rubble from the allied bombing.  The survivors were starving
to death and bands of Russian soldiers were wandering the streets looking for
payback.  Stalin had posters put up around the city
to encourage the army to unbelievable acts
of brutality and terror.  It was the very worst for the women of any age.

Billy was ten when given the important task of taking a clock and a small 
chest of drawers into the country to exchange for food.  Citizens were trading
any possessions that they might have to get enough food to survive another few 
days or weeks.

On this trip he was able to exchange the household items for a twenty-pound
sack of potatoes. Now Billy was perched precariously on the running boards of the
locomotive as it took him back home.  His most pressing concern was with all of
the hungry people that surrounded him.  It would be all too easy for anyone
to take the 
bag of taters from the young boy.

During that train ride Billy made a vow that if he ever survived that experience
he would never live in a city.  He would live somewhere far away where he could 
feed his family with food that they grew.

I met Bill Voigt thirty years later, living about fifty miles from the edge of 
civilization.  He and his family did survive the war.  But after the war they
ended up in the zone that was controlled by the Soviets.  They were able to
escape before the wall was in place to keep people from doing so.

His family fled to Uruguay and then immigrated to Canada.  As Bill told me this 
story, he had tears in his eyes.  It broke my heart.  In times of war, kids
suffer most.  War crushes all people, including the survivors, and the victors.

This story is replicated millions of times over.  I just had the privilege to
speak first hand with someone whose experience is beyond anything that I can 
imagine.  There are more refugees right now than at any time in the entire 
history of
the world. It should break our hearts and compel us to action.  No one can
do everything, but everyone can do something.

Hopefully your kids will never have to risk their lives for a bag of potatoes.
