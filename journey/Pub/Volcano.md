# Day on the Volcano

From the time I was a child I dreamed of being a 
[volcanologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanologist). The very thought
of climbing around on volcanoes and sampling molten rock sounded very exciting.
I grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona where there is an enormous amount of volcanic
history.

As I became an adult I never lost this fascination with volcanoes.  I have been
able to visit volcanoes in North America, Hawaii,  Costa Rica, and Peru.  But
today was going to be really special, a day to remember.

We were going to visit one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes in the
world.  I had no idea how interesting it would be.  

[Sakurajima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakurajima) 
(which means Cherry Blossom Island) has a history that belies its
docile name.  The volcano is not technically an island since the 1914 eruption
connected it to the mainland.  Sakurajima sits in the middle of a large bay on
the southern island of Kyushu, Japan.

The day was bright and clear as our adventure began.  Our new friends were to be
our tour guides.  Kennard was from Singapore and worked for the Japanese
government with our daughter Rachel.  His wife Tomoe was from Japan.

The five of us met at the ferry landing in Kagoshima, City.  We would take the
ferry to the volcano and drive our car around the island.  The ferry ride is
only 2 miles long.  This means that the base of the volcano is only about two
miles from the downtown skyscrapers.

Kagoshima is a city of 600,000 people and is the largest on the island of
Kyushu, which also houses Nagasaki.   The tall buildings have a great view of
the volcano summit just five miles away.  Citizens are treated to a front row
seat of the daily eruptions.

Sakurajima has been erupting consistently since 1955.  We were excited and a
little nervous about wanting to drive around the volcano.  We were hoping that
it would not have an eruption while we were up close and personal.

As we boarded the ferry, Tomoe told us that the Soba bowl (wheat noodles) was to
die for.  She didn't use those words but we knew what she meant.   The ferry
ride only lasts for 15 minutes and were hard pressed to devour the piping hot
Soba within the 10 minutes that we had.  But we proved to be up to the task and
it was a true delight.  Best Soba I had.

We drove off the ferry and went straight to the volcano visitors center.  There
we saw displays of the volcanic and seismic activity.   We were surprised to see
the growing trend line of eruptions.  Over the past three months the number of
eruptions had grown to an average of three each day.

We drove the car around the island. There is a small town where people live. 
The kids wear yellow hard hats to ward off the falling rocks.   There are also
concrete bunkers that are open on one side to allow people to hide in the case
of a pyroclastic flow.  Seams kind of iffy to me.

There are remnants of a small town that was buried in 1914 by lava flows from
the angry mountain.  A road led to an 
[observation point](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sakurajima/@31.555204,130.6788171,3a,75y,349.93h,90t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOv6_T_I_EDa3Rsx8WctjX79T91cvas-dWtDg3w!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOv6_T_I_EDa3Rsx8WctjX79T91cvas-dWtDg3w%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya180-ro0-fo100!7i7776!8i3888!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x353ef572006aed97:0x9765ad14cf618e94!2sSakurajima!3b1!8m2!3d31.583333!4d130.65!10e1!3m6!1s0x353ef572006aed97:0x9765ad14cf618e94!8m2!3d31.583333!4d130.65!14m1!1BCgIgARICCAI) 
with an overlook onto
the caldera. By the time we got there we could not see much for the smoke and
ash.  Not a place to linger.

Elsewhere we saw extensive earthen works meant to shore up the steep
mountainside.  This is intended to prevent erosion that could weaken the
mountain and trigger a deadly landslide, resulting in a pyroclastic flow.  This
is the most dangerous aspect of volcanoes. 

Being less than five miles away Sakurajima poses an imminent threat to the
citizens of Kagoshima City.

Rachel described how each day the people sweep the
ash from their porch and place it in small bags, to be collected weekly.  The
ask is very fine and used in cosmetics.

The typical eruption looks like a giant fist rising from the mountain.  The ash
cloud usually rises one to two miles, but occasionally makes it three miles
high.

On the roof of the shopping mall there is a ferris wheel.  This a great vantage
point to get a front row seat of the ash cloud as it towers above the Cherry
Blossom Island.  What a perfect day!
