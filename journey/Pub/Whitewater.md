# Whitewater Rafting

Life is a lot like river rafting.  I've had several whitewater experiences that were each exciting
and unique.  Each of them helped to shape my views on the process of life and the relationships
with the people in the raft.


## Payette River


My first river running was when I was just 22.  I was fresh out of college and working at HP.  A
group of engineers were working on planning a river run on the Payette River outside of Banks,
Idaho.

Stacie was 5 months pregnant with our first daughter and we considered not going.  At that time we
were inseparable and rarely did any activity apart from one another.  The river was mostly calm but
with a mix of class 3 and class 4 rapids.  We decided to risk it, but the river can be
unpredictable.

In the event, we did a stretch of river that contained a couple of class three rapids and a lot of
calm floating.  Then we went higher up the river to catch one awesome class four series of rapids.
For this we left Stacie safely on shore.  Each person needed to decide if the danger was worth the
thrill.  It totally was!


## Boise River


There is a small river that flows through downtown Boise.  It is perfect for innertubing.  Although
the water is cold the current is calm and there is little whitewater.  We put in just south of
town and continued to float along the greenbelt of the city, getting out at a city park.

We often floated on the river when we lived in Boise and enjoyed the experience. We were visiting
some friends several years after we had left.  We decided to float the Boise River with several
young kids.  The kids went in the raft with Stacie while the rest of the adults went in
innertubes. 

The one hazard on the river is when the current takes you into the trees. Stacie had several tense
moments being attacked by trees and the kids not helping with the paddling.  I don't think she had
much fun that day but we all got through safely.


## Poudre River


The next trip was about nine years later, just west of Ft. Collins, Colorado.  The Poudre River was
named by French trappers who hid gunpowder there back in the day.  This was another trip with
coworkers.

At that time I was working on commercializing a research project based on the doctoral dissertation
of a guy at HP Labs in Bristol, England. The team from the UK was visiting and we wanted to show
them what Coloradans do for fun.

Colorado weather is often quite volatile in the summer and one never really knows... The trip
started on a sunny morning but dark clouds were pouring over the Rockies.  

By the time we got the raft in the water, it began to rain.  Soon we were fearing for our lives.  At
least that how I recall it now.  Heavy rain, hail, and lightning striking on both banks made for a
memorable experience.


## Arkansas River


It is quite surprising that the river flowing through Little Rock starts about 100 miles west of
Colorado Springs.  That close to the continental divide the weather can be unpredictable, but it
was June when we decided to run the river.

There were about 16 church leaders that went for a team-building exercise on the Arkansas River. The
melting snow had swollen the river to flood stage. 

 Our fearless leader loved a great adventure and believed that everyone else should experience life
 through that lens.  Mike had lived in the area for many years and was able to point out each of
 the spots where people had perished and prepare us for the upcoming rapids.

The day started cool but there was little sun to warm us.  The water was a little above freezing and
the wool shirts were not enough to keep us warm.  We had a couple of people that began showing
signs of hypothermia. We lost no one, even though several people left the rafts in the rapids and
we had one raft that got wrapped onto a rock.

Today we can all laugh about the adventure but at the time we just prayed that it would be over soon
with no fatalities. The next morning we awoke to an inch of snow.  I guess in the end we learned
about how precious life is and felt that God does answer our prayers.


## Metaphor for Life


Whitewater rafting has become an important metaphor for me.  At my youngest daughter's wedding I
talked about how it provides a model for what life is like.  Times are calm where we crave
excitement and times of excitement where we crave calm.

From static to dynamic and back again.  From peace to turmoil ... repeat.  There are times when it
is sunny and warm, and others when you must focus on survival.  

There are a few things that are under our control.  When we are in crisis we must focus on the
actions that will get us through with the minimum injury.  While it is calm we must prepare for the
dangers ahead.

So much of what brings crisis is beyond our control and we must accept reality as it is rather than
as we wish it to be.  Finally, we must be aware of what is needed from us at any given moment.
