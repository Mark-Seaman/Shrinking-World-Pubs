# Technology Innovations

by Mark Seaman

Technology Innovations have profoundly shaped my life.  These are the tech 
products that had the largest impact on my daily life.

Technical innovation has been at the very heart of my career.   I have been
able to play a key role in many of the exciting breakthroughs, from Personal
Computers to Agile Software to Cloud Computing.

I've worked as a Software Developer, Architect, Entrepreneur, College Professor,
and Writer.   Each of these professions took me deeper into understanding how
technology affects our lives.  The impact can be both positive or negative
depending on how it is used.
