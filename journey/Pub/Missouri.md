# Banks of the Missouri

## Looking Toward the Future

As I stood overlooking the Missouri river far below I felt the weight of the
world on my shoulders.  Life happens while we make other plans, and I was not
enjoying the direction it was taking.  I wondered again whether the best years
were behind and all I had to look forward to was declining health, wealth, and
welfare.

This is the very spot where Lewis and Clark had spent the winter with the Mandan
tribe on their own adventure in 1802.  Now my unknown path ahead had me
contemplating the hardships that lay before me.  Numerous concerns were filling
my mind with dread for worst case scenarios that seemed quite likely.

I found myself grieving for all that was lost.  There is a graveyard overlooking
the river and that seemed like a peaceful place to walk.  As I strolled through
the gravestones, I noted the dates.  As I climbed higher on the hill the dates
got older.   I marveled at the gravestones for people that were born as early as
1820 in far away places.  What were their lives like? How did they end up here? 
What does our lifetime count for?

As I stood among the stones on the hill I was overtaken with sadness. I had such
hopes for all that I would do and be. But time was slipping by and opportunity
with it.  To be clear, I acknowledge that I have lived a life of extraordinary
privilege.  I have managed to have three lifetimes worth of experiences.  I had
been at the forefront of the personal computer revolution, interacted with many
famous people, traveled the world and raised an awesome  family knit together by
bonds of love.

But on that hill, I saw my own mortality, and all that I had done did not seem
quite enough.  Greed is a fundamental part of being human, and I wanted more. 
This made me angry at all of the circumstances that brought me here.  I wanted
to vent my frustration and find blame, but I knew deep down that everyone faces
suffering at some point.  Everyone dies but not everyone lives. I had truly
lived yet was hoping for more.


## Fateful Journey

On Mother's Day we had a royal feast.  The next day we were slated to drive to
South Dakota, to return my mother-in-law to her home.  We picked her up in
Arizona and brought her to Colorado to enjoy Mother's Day with us and all of our
family members.  She has 18 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.  It was
wonderful to have a celebration with four generations present.  

Stacie didn't sleep that night and we should have postponed the trip. We assumed
that it was from all of the partying we had done the day before. But we had
plans and forged ahead, despite any misgivings we had.  

By Cheyenne we experienced blizzard conditions that made it hard to see the road. But
soon the weather cleared and we pushed on.  Wyoming is famous for sudden and
severe weather that can undo the best laid plans.  Eventually we drove through
the snow storm and the roads cleared.

By lunch Stacie was in so much pain that she could not eat. We should have gone
to the hospital but we didn't.  We would get to South Dakota tonight and then we
could get help for Stacie.  Several hours later we found ourselves in the middle
of nowhere with no cell coverage and hours from the nearest hospital.

Another crisis was also brewing.  Our son had recently gotten a PhD and would soon
start a new job at a bio-tech company.  With the job offer in hand they were in
the process of closing on a new house. The day after Mother's Day, Josiah's job
offer suddenly fell through days before he was to start. 
We were traveling to South Dakota at the time.  With no job, it
would be impossible to buy a house.  Their lives had suddenly taken a dark turn
and ours as well.

We agreed to help arrange a loan for the house but we were traveling.  The
closing could not wait for good time and they were about to lose the house.  We
found ourselves trying to arrange loan financing in the middle of nowhere, with
spotty cell coverage, from a phone, with a sick woman, and an elderly
mother-in-law, on our way to South Dakota.  The stress of this situation was well
beyond my limit, but I was able to continue functioning by focusing on one
challenge at a time.

Our first priority was to get to the nearest hospital.  Both the available 
choices were
several hours away.  We thought we could make it but it was sobering to realize
that  calling an ambulance was not an option and that there was no hospital
within hours. We checked with locals about the two hospitals and discovered that the
hospital in Pierre had a bad reputation.  We decided to push on to Chamberlain
where we already had a hotel booked.


## Hospital Experience

As we drove the last stretch to the hospital Stacie was in intense pain.  She
was doing breathing exercises, while I drove faster, counting the minutes and
miles.  We knew it was serious  and prayed that we would make it in time.  We
did get to Chamberlain and checked grandma into the hotel and went immediately
to the hospital ER.  Stacie's sister arrived and took responsibility for getting
my mother-in-law home safely.

We arrived at dark to the ER, where they did tests that indicated gallbladder
problems.  After being re-hydrated by IV, Stacie was feeling much better.   They
sent us to the hotel and we planned to follow up later for potential surgery.
Chamberlain is a small town of 2500 people with a 25-bed hospital.  This is
not a good choice for where to have elective surgery.

After returning to the hotel at midnight for some much needed sleep, Stacie
slept for an hour.  She awoke to increased pain and we returned to be admitted
to the hospital at 2 am. A doctor examined her and ran tests to determine that
the gallbladder was acute and needed to be removed.  Surgery was scheduled right
away.

The elderly doctor had a great deal of experience and was very skilled.  He had
done over 2,000 gallbladder surgeries and claimed that Stacie's was the worst he
had ever seen.  This is not what you want to hear.  But the emergency surgery
may have saved her life.

As I stand in the graveyard overlooking the river I feel both grateful and
vulnerable at the same time.  I think about the calamity averted but realize
that it is never far away.  Our lives rest on a precipice which at any moment
may topple.  I look at the gravestones and wonder about those who have gone
before and what they experienced.


## The Larger World

The turmoil I was experiencing personally, is mirrored by the chaos of the world
around me.  The last year has been brutal. I have watched the steady decay of  our
entire society, churches, government, civil discourse, healthcare, education,
racial justice and growing wealth inequity. Events that I never expected to see
in my lifetime, occurred monthly and sometimes weekly to leave me in a perpetual
state of shock.

Sometimes the intense feelings of anger, sadness, fear, and shame threaten to
take me under. The problems around me seem so huge and I feel so inadequate to
change the world. It is at that point, where I accept that I did not create the
world and do not hold the responsibility to shape it.  I can only be true to
my destiny and that is enough.  Each one gets unique opportunities to have an
impact.

Grave markers remind me that the circumstances of our lives cannot be
controlled but that we do each have a key role to play.  Every day presents us
with opportunity to make the world around us a little better.  No one can do
everything, but everyone can do something.

Lewis and Clark opened the frontier and paved the way for others that would
follow.  Those gravestones mark the lives of women and men who took the next
steps.   It now falls to those of us who draw breath to do our part and make our
difference.  This will become our legacy and mark that we truly lived.  The
stones will someday bear testament that we traveled this way.
