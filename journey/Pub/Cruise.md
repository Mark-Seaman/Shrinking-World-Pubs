# Exploring the World

## Introduction

It has been years since we have traveled internationally. Our last trip was a river cruise through Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2018. That trip was so wonderful that we booked another river cruise for 2020. Then the pandemic happened and it changed everything.

During the pandemic my view of the inherent dangers of travel was filled with images of all that can go wrong. My desire to go abroad was overwhelmed by the desire for self-protection. Adventure was traded for safety. But five years later, I realize that I still have a desire for adventure. My remaining life should not be spent huddling in the safety and comfort of my home.

There are places in the world that I still want to visit. The questions then are:

- Where to go?
- When to go?
- How long?
- How much?


## Dreams of Nafplio

Stacie and I were making plans to spend a month in Nafplio, Greece, in the Peloponnese. We got as far as picking out an apartment online. This was the week that the pandemic started. Once again, our plans were dashed.

During this time I began to rethink the whole idea of foreign travel.  It seemed much safer to stay at home.
It was difficult to lose an area that had always been an important part of my life to that point.  I hated the
idea of living in fear of what might happen.  

Recently I have begun to experience a renewed longing to explore the world and have some adventure. I am too young
to give up on the things that I have loved in the past.  It is time to have an adventure.


## Breaking the Work Cycle

This year has been consumed with work projects that were extremely demanding. Stacie and I have created a software application to register students for an online university. I have created an online school with classes on Software Engineering and Web Development. I am currently teaching these two at the university. It is necessary to break this cycle of overwork, and the cruise seems like the solution.

While the project was satisfying it was also very exhausting for both Stacie and I.  We expended all of our
energy and margin in our lives.  We were unable to take any real vacations this year because of the work demands.
Now it is time to celebrate!


## A Bold Idea

We have also fantasized about the idea of taking a repositioning cruise across the Atlantic. Many cruise ships spend winter in the Gulf of Mexico and summer in the Mediterranean or Baltic. These cruises are very cheap for the length of time on the ship, and you still get to see a lot of port cities.

A few days ago, we started investigating repositioning cruises. We found a really good deal on Holland America and booked the trip shortly after. Part 1 is a 14-day cruise which starts in Ft. Lauderdale and goes to Azores, Ireland, Britain, France, Belgium, Netherlands. Part 2 is another 14-day cruise on the same ship. This will take us to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Germany.

We will be gone for a month and visit twelve different countries. We will add eight new countries to our personal list. This truly is a chance in a lifetime for us. There is a certain luxury of freedom at this stage of life. We are excited about using that freedom to explore the world.


## Join Our Adventure

I broke the cruise into two parts because many people might be able to take a 14-day cruise. Few people can break away for a month. Part 1 in a 14-day cruise from Florida to Amsterdam.  This is a repositioning cruise and is
quite economical.

Part 2 of the cruise starts and ends in Amsterdam. Interior cabins are only $1699/person at this time. This could end up being a cheap vacation.  We have been on several cruises and are so impressed with the convenience and 
economy.  You unpack once and your hotel moves in the night to the next city.

We would love to share this experience with friends and would like you to consider being a part of our adventure. Life is short, and friends make it more fun.

The Ultimate Adventure awaits those who are willing to step out of their comfort zones and embrace the world. Traveling internationally may have its challenges, but the rewards are endless.

So why wait? Break free from the cycle of work and join us on this cruise across the Atlantic or through Scandinavia.
Let's make memories that will last a lifetime.
