# My Life as a Writer

From a young age, I have always been fascinated by ideas. Bold, difficult ideas captivate my imagination, and I find
immense joy in exploring crazy, inventive concepts. The attraction to diverse thought processes and the enjoyment of
delving into new concepts is a cornerstone of my life as a writer. I believe that libraries are museums of human
thought, and I often find myself hanging out in libraries and bookstores. These places, especially old and historic
ones, are my sanctuaries where I can immerse myself in the vast array of human knowledge and creativity.

My journey as a writer began in college during a freshman English class. I discovered the joy of writing papers and
realized how enjoyable it was to express my thoughts through words. Writing quickly became more than just a task; it
became an integral part of my personal growth. Through writing, I process life, gain understanding, and embrace its
mysteries. My interests span from technology to philosophy, allowing me to explore a wide range of topics in my work.
Writing helps me connect with my inner self and the world around me, providing a sense of fulfillment and purpose. 

While I have never pursued commercial success, my focus has always been on striving for excellence in my craft. Whether
it's documenting software projects or penning down philosophical musings, writing remains a constant companion in my
quest to understand and articulate the world of ideas. This dedication to my craft is not about fame or fortune but
about the passion for expressing and refining my thoughts.


## Daily Writing

My life as a writer is extremely diverse.  I have a lot of different interests and it has taken me
several years to create methods of writing and publishing that are well-suited to my unique
personality quirks.

The one constant has been my practice of writing.  I try to spend between one and four hours each day
writing.  I have developed complete outlines for each major topical area that I am interested in
writing about, which guide the overall structure of what I write.

Daily activity, on the other hand, is completely freestyle and spontaneous. When I wake up each day,
I have no idea what I will end up writing about.  I do expect to create something great and that I
will enjoy the process of self-expression.

Once I am happy with the article, then it is posted into the venue where it belongs. This publishing
activity takes less than a minute and happens many times throughout the day.  This whole process is
optimized around writing so that publishing is fully automated. As soon as the content is written it
appears online.


## Autonomy

Most writers must make a living through their writing.  This means that everything they write is
done to fulfill the expectations of readers, critics, editors, publishers, and the general
marketplace. I have complete freedom in my writing because I do not need to make it profitable.
This is a luxury that many writers do not have. I and able to pursue the writing goals that excite
me on any given day.

Writing is my career, but not my job.  I invest in writing even though it will not be a source of
income.  It is my great joy and core to fulfilling my life's destiny.  I don't care much about what
publishers might think of my work because I am not writing for them.  I write for the thrill of it.


## Many Projects

I have numerous writing projects that keep me occupied. I love the act of writing and enjoy putting
ideas into words.   It took me a long time to realize that pursuing many goals is much more
enjoyable than focusing on a single work.

The main issue is my need for variety and novelty in my work. It is a thrill to start a new project
and is often a burden to write within the confines of a previous project.


## The Internet age

The way that people consume information is consistent with this type of writing. The internet has
changed how we think, and this is clear in how we now consume information.  People no longer are
likely to sit through a 1000-page book on a subject of casual interest, unless they are required
to.

The way that most people consume information is limited to very short articles that can be
digested quickly.  Current trends favor shorter articles of a single paragraph with 100-300 words.
Longer articles run around 1000 words (or four pages of typeset text).

For the last few years, I have tailored my writing to this new short attention span.  I now write
for readers who are accustomed to the internet, which trends to a short attention span (like that
of a squirrel). Large articles tend to be saved for later and often never read.

Readers also expect to be drawn into reading.  Having a great headline with 10 words creates 
curiosity that entices the reader to read the next paragraph with 100 words.  This may ultimately
result in the reader consuming a long article consisting of 1000 words.  I write in this style
(headline, paragraph, article) to earn the reader's trust gradually.


## Large Works

Is there a market for large works in the ADHD world?  I believe that there is. Some topics are
worth exploring in depth and people are willing to invest time and attention. But you must
earn their trust to maintain their attention. This requires authors to invest the
effort to create content worth reading.  It takes me about four hours to publish a four-page
article with 1000 words.

I have developed techniques for creating a writing structure that is composed by stacking small
pieces together like building blocks.  This allows me to write an article that consists of four
pages, each built with four paragraphs, each having a headline.  This provides a logical structure
to a single article with four distinct levels of detail: Headline, Paragraph, Page, and Article.

This big picture is also reflected in the outline for an entire book.  My books contain about
80,000 words (320 pages) but are built using the structure described earlier.  I organize the
content into six distinct tiers that are nested like the Russian Babushka dolls.

Having this outline gives the work integrity that the audience can appreciate.  A
book written in this style is intended to convey an entire body of knowledge about a complete
subject.  Logical consistency helps the reader to embrace the information that is presented.


## Small Works

Most readers have a limit on how much they will consume in one sitting.  Authors must cater to this
new mentality and be able to deliver the appropriate payload. Start at the smallest level to express
the big idea and then work down from there. 

A great headline sparks creativity for the author while getting you to think about how to engage the
reader. There is a whole science around writing headlines for articles (click-bait to the cynically
minded).  Make a headline that invokes curiosity.

I like to think about what I say as a pyramid of words with different levels of detail in
the payload.  It starts with a great headline where I get 10 words to tell the story.  The reader
may stop there or opt for more.

The first 100 words should lay out the same concept and deliver some details promised by the
headline.  The next 1,000 words should follow the same pattern by introducing new aspects of the
story with great subheadings and then delivering on each new promise.

A long article can be built so that it consists of four separate ideas.  Create material that can
be understood by itself, but is also a part of a larger discussion.


## Micropublishing

The power of this approach is that it provides a great deal of flexibility for both writing and
publishing.  The basic building block for all of my writing is a single page consisting of 250
words of text.  A reader can easily digest this content in 5 minutes.

Smaller messages can be extracted from each paragraph on the page.  This can be used for Twitter or
other social networking apps or SMS messages. Twitter limits the message length to 140 characters
since it was built on top of text messages(SMS).  This constraint is perfect for fitting a headline
and hyperlink.  Linking to a web page is the best way to provide more content with a single
click.

On the other end, four related pages describing different aspects of a topic can be joined together
to form a well-structured long article.  It will take the typical reader 20 minutes to absorb and
understand this content. I recommend not publishing articles that are longer than this because
it presents a challenge to the audience.

I have been working on software to publish content using these principles. The idea of 
Micropublishing calls for authors to create structured information that can be easily presented 
in small chunks (one page at a time) and lets the reader navigate through the content from any 
starting point.
