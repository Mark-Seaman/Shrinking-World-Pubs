# Life at 40 Something

Entering our forties brought profound changes to our lives, with a series of significant events and transitions that reshaped our perspectives and priorities.  The changes started as we turned 40 but would take the entire decade to see the full implications.

Our forties were a time of transformation, marked by significant life events and deep introspection. Stacie's new career, our evolving roles as parents, my departure from HP, and our global travels all contributed to a period of growth and change. 

This decade taught us the importance of adaptability and the value of seeking purpose beyond conventional success. It underscored the significance of financial planning and the joy of exploring the world. Most importantly, it reinforced our commitment to living lives aligned with our values, fostering both personal and collective growth.

As we look back, these years stand out as a pivotal chapter in our journey, shaping us into more resilient, reflective, and purpose-driven individuals.


## Career Changes

### HP

The most significant change during our forties was my departure from HP. After years of dedicated service, I felt a
growing misalignment between my values and the company's direction. After the founder's departure, HP underwent a
series of changes that shifted its focus away from innovation and employee well-being. 

The decision to leave was not easy, but it marked a
turning point in my professional journey. I sought new opportunities that aligned with my evolving priorities and
values, leading me to explore different paths and possibilities.

HP began a long, steady decline, characterized by a rush to outsource previously in-house tasks. This shift led me to
question my future with the company, ultimately resulting in my decision to leave as I sought new professional and
personal fulfillment.

My last role at HP was as a software process architect.  We were working on a team that involved 700 people across 
three continents.  This was the worst job of my career.  

I finally made a decision to leave HP in 2007.  I had been there for 26 years.  I was 47 years old.  But the challenge
was to find new work that would be fulfilling and rewarding.  I had been at HP for so long that I had no idea what
else I could do. 

### Banner Health

Stacie graduated from nursing school, marking the beginning of a new and fulfilling career for her. This accomplishment
was a testament to her dedication and hard work, opening up new possibilities for our family.

Stacie graduated from nursing school at age 40 and began working at Banner Health.  She started as a nurse in the
cardiac unit. She was very successful but the physical demands of 12 hour shifts were not sustainable.  After four years
she moved to the information technology department and was promoted to a director.  Her group had clinical personel that
managed the software across 7 states and 21 hospitals within the Banner Health System.

She was very happy and very effective in this role.  She was often given the most difficult teams and projects because
she was so good at getting them to work together and be successful.  She worked at Banner Health for 14 years before
retiring to join my software business.


## Family and Parenting

Christine graduated from High School in 2001, and we had to adjust our parenting style to accommodate her growing
independence. This transition was challenging but rewarding, as we learned to trust our children's judgment and provide
support while allowing them to make their own decisions.  If anyone tells you this is easy, they are lying.  With 
each child, it was a new experience and a new challenge.  But we were always there for them and they knew it.


## World Travel

Our first trip to Hawaii in 2001 marked the beginning of our passion for foreign travel. This experience opened our
eyes to the beauty and diversity of the world, inspiring us to explore new cultures and landscapes. Over the next
decade, we traveled to Greece, England, Peru, Japan, India, and Costa Rica, among other destinations. These trips
enriched our lives and broadened our perspectives, reinforcing our belief in the transformative power of travel.

We bought a timeshare in Hawaii in 2001 and returned there every year for 22 years.  We began to travel to many other
destinations throughout the world.  Each trip provided us to new ways to travel.

We took our kids on many of these trips and it impacted their lives in a very positive way.  Rachel ended up living in
Japan for 3 years and Josiah moved to England for 4 years.  


## Church Life

We joined a new church, which brought fresh experiences and a different community dynamic. We saw some new models of
ministry and leadership.  We would be a part of Christ Community Church for 10 years and continued to grow and learn.

Despite professional success, I felt a deep discontent and embarked on a quest to understand my life's purpose. This
journey was about finding meaning beyond career achievements, seeking a deeper sense of fulfillment through
contributions that resonated with my values.

I considered going into full-time ministry, but I am a lot more suited to be an engineer, writer, and teacher.  
I don't think I would have been effective as a pastor.  


## Financial Planning and Retirement

We carefully evaluated our financial situation and decided that by age 45, we had saved enough for our retirement. Our
focus shifted from accumulating wealth to preserving what we had, ensuring it continued to grow without depleting our
savings.  We continued to live on a budget and tried to give as much away as we could.  We were able to retire at age 
55 with enough money to live comfortably for the rest of our lives.
