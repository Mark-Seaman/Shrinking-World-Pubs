# Adventures in Greece


## Incoming Aircraft

Kimon stood on the hillside not far from his small village. He was in shock and
awe.  Airplanes kept rolling in ... wave after wave.  It must have been
terrifying and mesmerizing.

He had probably heard his parents discuss the war but did not believe that it would ever come to his home village. But
now the planes were coming in faster than anyone could imagine. The planes where filled with soldiers coming to bring
death to everyone that opposed them.  The sky was filled with parachutes as the men raced toward the ground so that
their work could begin.  They were on a mission of great importance, creating a foothold for what to follow.

As a boy of ten, Kimon could not understand the changes that were about to
happen to his peaceful village home.  But he knew it was bad ... really bad.  It
took eleven days for the Nazis to completely subdue Crete, and bring it under
the shroud of Mordor.  By late May in 1941 it was a done deal.

But the true evil released that day was a culmination of events that were set in
motion twenty-one years earlier in a country far to the north.  Hitler made his
first play for government in 1923 in Munich.  About two thousand men marched to 
the center of town, where they confronted the police resulting in the death of 
sixteen Nazis and four policemen. Hitler himself was wounded during the clash.

Although he was charged with treason he converted his trial to an opportunity to
publicize in nationalist agenda.  He captured headlines and became the talk of
the nation.  He was sentenced to five years in prison and served nine months,
when he documented his plan for world domination that he almost achieved.

Hitler rose to power on a tide of national anger and a desire to strike back.
He was wildly popular with those that felt their opportunities for a good life
had been stolen.

Hitler was a rousing spokesman.  He was wildly popular with the average citizen
who had lost hope in the future.  He was able to draw large crowds and whip them
into a frenzy.  He told them that he had all of the answers and that he would
make Germany Great Again.  He was able to convince the disenfranchised that they
had been cheated out of what was rightfully theirs by foreigners and Jews.

He won the hearts and minds of enough of the population that they did not hold
him accountable for the atrocious injustice that characterized his entire leadership.
When leaders demonstrate a lack of integrity they must be opposed before they
consolidate power.  Otherwise it may be too late.

Ten years later, in 1933, he was Chancellor and the world would weep. Within a decade
everyone of fighting age around the globe would be called to fight for or against
this monster.  Parents and children would look on in horror as soldiers drove
over their towns and cities.

Hitler rising to power was not a foregone conclusion, it was far from inevitable.
There was a period of time when people of courage could have stepped forward to
prevent his rise to power. From 1929 to 1933 he could have easily been stopped,
but by 1933 he had all the power, and the world would pay... big time.

Now eight years after Hitler's rise, Kimon got a first hand view of the war as
it came to his  small village.  The next five years were unbelievably hard as
the family experienced the brutal leadership of the Nazi occupation.  Ultimately,
Kimon did survive the war and wrote a book about his experience.  He became my
dad's closest friend and as a result our families have been connected for
decades.

Think about the logical consequences of allowing dictators to rise to positions
of authority and power. With modern weapons and surveillance techniques the
damage that a dictator would do is beyond imagination.  The evil that could be
released by the United States on the rest of the world would dwarf the
greatest accomplishments of Adolf in his prime.

During our year in Greece (1969-1970), my dad became close friends with Kimon 
Farantakis.  Kimon wrote a book about his childhood years in Crete.  "The 
Leaden-sky Years of World War II" was published in Greek and became quite 
popular, but was not available in English.  My father translated his friend's
memoir into English so that it would be available to a wider audience.

The Seaman family and the Farantakis family have maintained lifelong friendships
and taken 16 trips both ways across the ocean over the past five decades.  Some 
relationships can transcend time and space.


## Careful what you say

"Be extremely careful what you say because the government is listening to all of
our conversations", I recall Dad telling us.  One misspoken word could get us
sent to prison or worse. Even as a child I knew that this could not possibly be
true.  My dad didn't seem like one that would be prone to paranoia, but what he
was saying sounded a little crazy.

Being raised in small-town America I had no sense of global politics.  The
biggest drama in my life was whether Batman would be turned into a human
popsicle by the Joker.  It was hard for me to comprehend that we could be in
any real danger.

We had all of these serious conversations in our car, since it would be
difficult to record them given the technology of the time.  Naturally we kids
played along even though we did not really believe my father's warnings.

We knew that governments are basically good and are meant to protect their
people.  Apart from a few baddies, like Hitler and Stalin, nations are run by
well meaning leaders that can be trusted.  People do not just disappear for no
reason.  Secret police do not arrest people and torture them without just cause.
Citizens do not fear their leaders.

As events would soon reveal this is not always the case.  Our time overseas
proved to be more interesting that any of us were ready for.  And Dave, my dad,
was the only one with any inkling of the true danger that surrounded us.

The government was held in power by large numbers of secret police.  They had a
reputation for surveillance and impromptu interrogations.  Of course the police were
just doing there job; the real villains of the story were the colonels that
deposed the king. They set up a new government after the coup which controlled the
country by fear.  The press was regulated and citizens were under the constant 
threat of simply disappearing.

Certain books, movies, and music were outlawed because they might lead people
into rebellious ideas.  Everything was viewed with suspicion and neighbors were
encouraged to report their friends so that the police could investigate.  One
casual word against the current rulers was enough to get anyone arrested.

A trusted friend told Dave that the landlady who lived in our apartment
building had a brother that was a member of the secret police.  He was also alerted
that someone had been in our apartment. Sure enough, after searching the
apartment, he found a bug inside of our telephone receiver.

He decided that the least suspicious thing would be to leave the bug in place
and to warn the family to be very careful of what was said on the phone or even
in the house.  And so, that day we got the first of the security briefings while
driving about in our car.

I was excited to imagine that we were somehow involved in a resistance movement
against an evil dictatorship.  But for my parents the situation very different.
My dad was frightened that we would do or say something that would get us 
deported or imprisoned.  

But I think that the biggest toll was on my mom. She had agreed to be a part of
a European adventure that had suddenly taken a serious turn.  She did not really
anticipate having the "Loose lips sink ships" conversation as part of our 
family meeting.  I think in a totalitarian regime that the women suffer most.

My dad was a college professor with no political agenda.  His role was to teach
English at the University of Athens. He had not fully considered the implications
of living in a dictatorship until he was in the middle of it. Everyone was under
a cloud of suspicion and a potential target of investigation.

When governments are motivated solely by the need to control their people,
there is nothing they will not do.  The greater the insecurity of the leaders
the more ruthless they become in silencing dissent.

This has a devastating impact on daily life.  As people grow to fear the government,
they rid themselves of all other goals.  Daily life is reduced to avoiding the
attention of the government that is constantly searching for rebels and even
rebel sympathizers.

Even as a child of ten, I could see that this is wrong.  But today I grieve the
fact that many Americans do not even see this as a danger for our country. We
believe that the government should be granted unlimited power because it will
always act in our best interest.  All it takes is one sudden political change
and we enter into an entirely new reality.

The events of the last few years have been a chilling reminder that we too 
could quite easily slide into a dictatorship. The would change everything that
we know and love about America.


## Pizza and Prison

Greece has far better pizza than Italy. The best pizza I've ever had was at a
hotel on the outskirts of Athens.  After all these years I still recall the rich
aroma of the garlic infused dough with sausage and olives.

I remember that my parents were very tense over the circumstances that had
brought us to the hotel in first place.  For me it was a fun outing but for them
it was a waking nightmare.

There were four administrative assistants in the Fulbright office where Dave, my father, 
worked: a typist, travel coordinator, finance, and assistant for the head of the
English program in Greece.

One of them was a sympathizer and spy for the government and another would
end up in prison as a result.  When the government goes corrupt everyone is
forced to choose a side.  The spy probably saw an easy way to advance either
professionally or politically by selling out her coworker.

Rita may have actually been guilty of the crimes that she was accused of but 
there were no charges, no trial, and no paper trail.  These things are considered
needless overhead and a frivolous waste of time in a brutal dictatorship.  The
task of controlling people takes precedent over everything else.

She was picked up by police one day and ordered to spy on the Fulbright office
where my dad worked.  She refused and was arrested, imprisoned and tortured.  My
dad recalls that they used a yellow VW with a New Jersey license plate to pick
her up.  Fortunately, a friend of my dad's who worked at the US Embassy became
aware of the arrest or she would have likely perished in prison, with no one
ever knowing what happened to here.  

The government  had eyes and ears everywhere, just talking to someone that was
under suspicion was enough to cast suspicion on you. Although no charges were
ever filed, she simply vanished one day.  Dave spent several hours trying to
locate her whereabouts, including working his contacts at the American State
Department and Red Cross.

A contact at the International Red Cross confirmed that she had been arrested
and taken to a building within sight of the American Embassy. There she would be
tortured to try to find more contacts requiring follow up.  Then she would likely
disappear as was the standard practice at the time. Someday underwater
archaeologists will find a lot of skeletons with cement boots.

Things became quite tense at the Fulbright office, as you can imagine. Think
about working each day next to the very woman that deliberately caused the
death of a coworker.  The fear and anger must have been unbearable.

Three of the foreigners that worked at the office, including my dad, went to the place of torture 
where they were holding Rita and demanded to see her. They refused, but finally allowed
the team to send her a note in Greek and her to write a brief response.  It may well
have saved her life.  This kind of aggressive action would also be considered 
treasonous and grounds for imprisonment, but the status as highly visible 
foreigners probably protected them.

Shortly after that, the three academics were all summoned to the impressive
residence of the American ambassador to Greece, who told them in no uncertain
terms that they  were jeopardizing the Fulbright program in Greece.  They were
ordered to back off  by the ambassador and were supposed to be intimidated. But
the three continued to take Rita's mom out on a regular basis.

In fact, the American government was supporting the dictatorship at the time.
This gave the Americans a certain amount of protection against the normal
ruthless actions of the government. Later some American president
apologized to the Greek people for the American support of that military junta.

The authorities could not get Rita to cooperate so they keep her in solitary
confinement in a hotel that had been converted into a prison.  The prison hotel was next                    
door to a restaurant which served fantastic pizza. No one could see her, nor communicate 
with her in any way.  

Our family used to drive by where we knew her room balcony was at a particular
time each day. She would wave subtly to us and this simple gesture provided
assurance for her and for us.

Three of the workers at the Fulbright office took turns picking up Rita's mother 
and taking bread and a thermos of soup to the prison hotel to leave for Rita. 
Otherwise they would gladly have left her to starve to death.

Finally the Greek government admitted that she was being housed at the time in
the hotel near Marathon, close to the marble quarries for the Parthenon.  Dave
was given permission to visit her; so on this particular Sunday we were eating
pizza at the prison hotel.

One day Dad and Rita's mom were permitted to visit her while our family ate pizza at the 
restaurant next to the prison hotel.  Greece was under the
thumb of a military dictatorship at the time.  People disappearing in the middle
of the night was common practice.  It was also common practice to arrest anyone
who inquired about their disappearance.  What was uncommon was that someone 
would be able to speak out on behalf of the accused.

Fortunately we had a certain amount of protection by being American citizens.
My dad, was a university professor and well connected with the American Embassy.
The poor secretary was a Greek citizen and was at the mercy of the dictator.

This was not the first time nor the last that Dave came up in direct conflict
with the dictatorship.  It is the destiny of rebels to fight oppressors.  
Protecting the oppressed who have no defender is at the heart of meaning of
true liberty.
