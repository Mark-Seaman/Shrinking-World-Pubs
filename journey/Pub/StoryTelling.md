# The Art of Storytelling

As a writer, I find immense joy in sharing stories about the places I've visited, the experiences I've had, and the
fascinating people I've met along the way. Storytelling is an inherent part of being human; it allows us to imagine
lives beyond our own experiences.

Over the past ten years, I've been dedicated to writing my life story. This journey began when my father published his
autobiography, inspiring me to document my own adventures. Initially, I thought this project would take about a year.
However, a decade later, I am still adding stories and estimate that I am only halfway through.

I employ a method I call Micropublishing, which sits somewhere between Blogging and Traditional Publishing. Writing a
book is a monumental task that demands between 1,000 and 2,000 hours of intense effort. While blogging offers quick
access to readers, it often lacks the careful preparation that goes into a book.

Each week, I deliver well-crafted and thoughtful articles that contribute to a larger narrative. These pieces are
published on a website and are immediately available for readers. I continuously add new content and refine existing
material. Once the collection feels complete, I publish it as an ebook on the Amazon Kindle store.

Readers don't need to wait for the ebook, but the Kindle reading experience is more enjoyable than browsing the website.
Through Micropublishing, I've published several books and am currently working on about half a dozen more on various
topics.

One of my projects, "A Seaman's Journey," is a collection of stories from my life, focusing on three main themes:
family, career, and travel. In these areas, I've been privileged to have experiences that far exceed what most people
encounter.

I share my struggles to overcome numerous challenges and highlight the people who have been part of my journey. I delve
into early life decisions that had profound consequences decades later, striving to be brutally honest about both my
failures and triumphs.

I choose stories that have shaped my worldview, moments that influenced how I perceive the world and myself. To explore
these tales, visit [A Seaman's Journey](http://markseaman.org/journey).
