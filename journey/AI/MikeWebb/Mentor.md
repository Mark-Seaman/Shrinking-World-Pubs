# My Mentor Mike Webb


Everybody needs a mentor in their life, someone to guide them and impart wisdom. When I was 25, I
met Mike Webb, an older man with a wealth of experience and wisdom, who would become my mentor,
comrade, and spiritual father.

Mike was 32 when I first met him. I was drawn to his intelligence, humor, and adventurous spirit. He
had an insatiable curiosity about life and seemed to be full of ideas. We quickly became friends,
and our many adventures together helped form a bond that would last a lifetime.

At first, I didn't realize how much Mike was teaching me. I thought we were just having fun, but as
time went on, I began to understand how much he was challenging me to be my best. He was always
able to speak the truth in love, even when it was difficult. He was willing to confront me when
necessary and always inspired me to push myself to be more.

Mike was more than just a mentor and comrade; he was also a spiritual father to me. Over the years,
I had many teachers, but Mike was the one I respected and admired the most. I wanted to emulate
him, to be like him. He had a way of leading by example, of showing me how to live my best life,
and I followed every step of the way.

Mike's impact on my life cannot be overstated. He taught me about life, challenged me to be my best,
and modeled what it meant to live a life of purpose and meaning. I am grateful for the time I had
with him, and I will always remember the lessons he taught me.

In the end, Mike wasn't just a mentor; he was a father figure to me. He helped shape me into the
person I am today, and I am forever grateful for his influence. If you're fortunate enough to have
a mentor like Mike in your life, cherish them, learn from them, and emulate them. They will help
you become the best version of yourself.
