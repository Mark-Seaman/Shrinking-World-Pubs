# Mike Webb is Larger Than Life


Mike Webb was a remarkable man who lived a life full of adventure, innovation, and impact. Mike was
a pioneer in so many ways, always pushing the boundaries and challenging himself to do more.

As an innovator, Mike was always searching for new ways to make the world a better place. He got
involved in fish farming, and he set up a fish farm in the basement of the church he pastored. This
also eventually led him to travel Africa, Cambodia, Cuba, and Mexico. 

He was a trainer for missions work and led annual teams to build houses
in Mexico. His dedication to finding new solutions and testing new ideas was truly inspiring.


But Mike wasn't content to simply innovate, he was an adventurer at heart. He lived a life full of
excitement and new experiences. He believed that life was an adventure and he never wasted a moment
of it. He traveled the world, made countless missionary friends, and helped train many leaders that
would plant churches around the globe. His adventurous spirit always inspired those around him.

Mike was also known for his contrarian and rebellious nature. He was never content to follow the
crowd or seek approval from others. He was always swimming upstream and pushing against the status
quo. His independent thinking and self-motivation were admirable traits that many of us will always
remember.

Mike would see a  problem that needed to be solved and felt like he could make a contribution. We
built and operated the first online store for Vineyard Music in the early days of the internet. 

Above all, Mike was impactful. He changed lives wherever he went. He dedicated himself to community
service, mentoring others, and empowering those around him. He had a kind and generous heart that
touched the lives of countless people. His impact will be felt for years to come.

Mike Webb was a true inspiration, a pioneer in so many ways. He lived a life of adventure,
innovation, and impact.
