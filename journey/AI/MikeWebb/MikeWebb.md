# Mike Webb: Larger Than Life

## Adventurer and Innovator

Mike Webb was a remarkable man who lived a life full of adventure, innovation, and impact. Mike was
a pioneer in so many ways, always pushing the boundaries and challenging himself to do more.

As an innovator, Mike was always searching for new ways to make the world a better place. He got
involved in fish farming, and he set up a fish farm in the basement of the church he pastored. This
also eventually led him to travel Africa, Cambodia, Cuba, and Mexico. 

He was a trainer for missions work and led annual teams to build houses
in Mexico. His dedication to finding new solutions and testing new ideas was truly inspiring.


But Mike wasn't content to simply innovate, he was an adventurer at heart. He lived a life full of
excitement and new experiences. He believed that life was an adventure and he never wasted a moment
of it. He traveled the world, made countless missionary friends, and helped train many leaders that
would plant churches around the globe. His adventurous spirit always inspired those around him.

Mike was also known for his contrarian and rebellious nature. He was never content to follow the
crowd or seek approval from others. He was always swimming upstream and pushing against the status
quo. His independent thinking and self-motivation were admirable traits that many of us will always
remember.

Mike would see a  problem that needed to be solved and felt like he could make a contribution. We
built and operated the first online store for Vineyard Music in the early days of the internet. 

Above all, Mike was impactful. He changed lives wherever he went. He dedicated himself to community
service, mentoring others, and empowering those around him. He had a kind and generous heart that
touched the lives of countless people. His impact will be felt for years to come.

Mike Webb was a true inspiration, a pioneer in so many ways. He lived a life of adventure,
innovation, and impact. 


## My Mentor


Everybody needs a mentor in their life, someone to guide them and impart wisdom. When I was 25, I
met Mike Webb, an older man with a wealth of experience and wisdom, who would become my mentor,
comrade, and spiritual father.

Mike was 32 when I first met him. I was drawn to his intelligence, humor, and adventurous spirit. He
had an insatiable curiosity about life and seemed to be full of ideas. We quickly became friends,
and our many adventures together helped form a bond that would last a lifetime.

At first, I didn't realize how much Mike was teaching me. I thought we were just having fun, but as
time went on, I began to understand how much he was challenging me to be my best. He was always
able to speak the truth in love, even when it was difficult. He was willing to confront me when
necessary and always inspired me to push myself to be more.

Mike was more than just a mentor and comrade; he was also a spiritual father to me. Over the years,
I had many teachers, but Mike was the one I respected and admired the most. I wanted to emulate
him, to be like him. He had a way of leading by example, of showing me how to live my best life,
and I followed every step of the way.

Mike's impact on my life cannot be overstated. He taught me about life, challenged me to be my best,
and modeled what it meant to live a life of purpose and meaning. I am grateful for the time I had
with him, and I will always remember the lessons he taught me.

In the end, Mike wasn't just a mentor; he was a father figure to me. He helped shape me into the
person I am today, and I am forever grateful for his influence. If you're fortunate enough to have
a mentor like Mike in your life, cherish them, learn from them, and emulate them. They will help
you become the best version of yourself.


## Ministry Philosophy

Mike Webb is a man with a vision for ministry that truly embodies the concept of inclusivity. In his
approach to serving the community, he prioritizes breaking down barriers, empowering marginalized
groups, and embracing diversity in all forms. This is reflected in his five key areas of focus:
inclusivity, women in ministry and marriage partnership, every tribe and language, equity and
inclusion, and care for defenseless. We can all learn from Mike's approach and work towards
embodying these values in our own lives and ministries.

At the heart of Mike Webb's ministry philosophy is inclusivity. He believes that all are welcome, no
matter who they are or where they come from. Cultural competence, open-mindedness, and flexibility
are all critical components of this approach. Mike recognizes and celebrates the inherent value of
diversity in leadership and is committed to creating spaces in which everyone can thrive. By
breaking down barriers, Mike strives to ensure that everyone feels welcome and that power
structures are dismantled.

Mike also champions women in ministry, seeing them as essential partners in God's work. He
understands that women have been historically marginalized in the church and is committed to
empowering them in leadership roles. With a biblical basis for equality, Mike believes that women
should be given the same opportunities as men to serve in the church. He sees marriage as a
partnership, where both individuals are valued for their unique contributions.

Every tribe and language is another key area of focus for Mike. He views cross-cultural engagement
as essential to the ministry and seeks to celebrate the cultural identities of all those he serves.
Learning and teaching are key components of this approach, as Mike recognizes that
language barriers can be significant obstacles to effective communication and understanding.
Missions, both local and global, are also critical components of this approach.

Equity and inclusion are another essential pillar of Mike's ministry philosophy. He is committed to
fighting for justice and advocating for marginalized groups. Serving underserved communities is a
top priority, and Mike believes that creating equitable spaces means recognizing and addressing
systemic inequalities. He is determined to be a voice for those who have been silenced and to work
for change in all its forms.

Finally, caring for the defenseless is an area that is particularly meaningful to Mike. He believes
that we are called to care for the poor and homeless, protect vulnerable populations, and support
orphanages and foster homes. Humanitarian work such as disaster relief is also critical to this
approach. Mike is deeply committed to serving those who are in need and is motivated by the belief
that it is our responsibility as Christians to love and care for one another.


## Legacy

Mike Webb was a man who lived his life with eternal purpose in mind. He understood that our time on
earth is limited, but the impact we make can last for eternity. His legacy is one of total
surrender to Jesus' plan, selflessness, and a willingness to take risks for the sake of the
Gospel.

Mike believed in dying to self and living for Christ. He knew that only by losing our lives can we
truly find Christ's life. He embraced the cross daily and replaced his own selfish desires with a
heart of servanthood and love.

Not everyone lives, but Mike did. He invested his time, talents, and resources into furthering God's
Kingdom on earth. His focus was on leaving a lasting impact for Christ, showing love through
actions, pursuing justice and mercy for the oppressed, and engaging in evangelism and
discipleship.

Mike's dedication to serving God was evident in everything he did. He put God's Kingdom first and
obeyed God's Word above all else. He fostered a heart of worship and prayer and prioritized
investing in relationships with other believers. He was generous and a faithful steward of his
resources.

Mike's legacy is one that challenges each of us to serve God today. He knew that we shouldn't delay
in obedience to God's call, but rather follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and use our spiritual
gifts for God's glory. He sought opportunities to bless and encourage others, always striving to be
a doer of Jesus' works.

Mike's life may have ended, but his legacy lives on. He left a powerful example of what it means to
live for Christ and to serve God with every breath we take. May we all be inspired by his example
and seek to serve God wholeheartedly, just as Mike did.
