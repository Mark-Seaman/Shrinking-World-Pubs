# Mike Webb's Legacy

Mike Webb was a man who lived his life with eternal purpose in mind. He understood that our time on
earth is limited, but the impact we make can last for eternity. His legacy is one of total
surrender to Jesus' plan, selflessness, and a willingness to take risks for the sake of the
Gospel.

Mike believed in dying to self and living for Christ. He knew that only by losing our lives can we
truly find Christ's life. He embraced the cross daily and replaced his own selfish desires with a
heart of servanthood and love.

Not everyone lives, but Mike did. He invested his time, talents, and resources into furthering God's
Kingdom on earth. His focus was on leaving a lasting impact for Christ, showing love through
actions, pursuing justice and mercy for the oppressed, and engaging in evangelism and
discipleship.

Mike's dedication to serving God was evident in everything he did. He put God's Kingdom first and
obeyed God's Word above all else. He fostered a heart of worship and prayer and prioritized
investing in relationships with other believers. He was generous and a faithful steward of his
resources.

Mike's legacy is one that challenges each of us to serve God today. He knew that we shouldn't delay
in obedience to God's call, but rather follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and use our spiritual
gifts for God's glory. He sought opportunities to bless and encourage others, always striving to be
a doer of Jesus' works.

Mike's life may have ended, but his legacy lives on. He left a powerful example of what it means to
live for Christ and to serve God with every breath we take. May we all be inspired by his example
and seek to serve God wholeheartedly, just as Mike did.
