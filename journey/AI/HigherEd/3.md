## The Rise of Competency-Based Education

Higher education is experiencing a shift towards competency-based education, which is challenging
the traditional notion of learning and assessment. This new approach focuses on measuring knowledge
and skills rather than the time spent in a classroom. It offers an opportunity for learners to
progress at their own pace and emphasizes real-world application and competency mastery.

The traditional higher education model places a heavy emphasis on seat time, where students are
required to attend classes for a specific number of hours. This approach assumes that students
acquire knowledge and skills by simply being present in a classroom. However, this may not
necessarily be the most effective way for individuals to learn and demonstrate their
understanding.

Competency-based education, on the other hand, allows learners to demonstrate their knowledge and
skills through various assessments, such as projects, portfolios, and exams. It focuses on what a
student can do rather than how long they have spent learning. This approach promotes a deeper
understanding of the subject matter and encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Moreover, competency-based education is aligned with workforce needs and job market demands. In
today's rapidly changing world, employers are seeking candidates who can demonstrate practical
skills and apply their knowledge to real-world situations. Competency-based education provides
learners with the opportunity to acquire these skills and become better prepared for the demands of
the job market.

However, the rise of competency-based education also poses certain challenges. It requires a shift
in teaching practices and assessment methods, which may be met with resistance from traditional
educators. Additionally, developing and implementing competency-based programs requires significant
resources and infrastructure.
