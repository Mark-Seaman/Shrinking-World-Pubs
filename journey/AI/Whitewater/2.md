Whitewater rafting is often compared to the journey of life. I have had several exhilarating and unique experiences on the river, each of which has shaped my perspective on life and the relationships formed in the raft.

One of my earliest river runs occurred right after I graduated from college at the age of 22. I had just begun working at HP when a group of engineers planned a river run on the Payette River in Banks, Idaho. However, Stacie, my partner, was five months pregnant with our first daughter, causing us to hesitate about participating. At the time, we were inseparable and rarely did anything separately. Although the river was mostly calm, with a mix of class 3 and class 4 rapids, we weighed the risks and decided to go for it. The unpredictability of the river added an extra element of excitement.

During the river run, we navigated a stretch of calm water interspersed with a couple of class three rapids. Then, we ventured further upstream to tackle an awe-inspiring class four rapid series. For this particular challenge, we made the decision to leave Stacie safely on shore. Each person had to assess whether the thrill was worth the potential danger. Without a doubt, it was.

Another memorable river experience took place on the Boise River, a small river that flows through downtown Boise. This river was perfect for innertubing, as it had a calm current and very little whitewater. We frequently enjoyed floating on this river while living in Boise. Several years after we had moved away, we decided to visit friends and float the Boise River once again. This time, we brought along several young kids. Stacie took charge of the raft, while the rest of the adults opted for innertubes.

One obstacle we encountered on the Boise River was when the current carried us into trees. Stacie faced some tense moments as she was repeatedly attacked by branches, and the kids were not much help with the paddling. It was not the most enjoyable experience for her, but thankfully, we all made it through safely.

About nine years later, I embarked on another rafting trip, this time on the Poudre River just west of Ft. Collins, Colorado. The Poudre River got its name from French trappers who once hid gunpowder in the area. This particular adventure was organized with my coworkers. At the time, I was heavily involved in the commercialization of a research project based on the doctoral dissertation of a colleague from HP Labs in Bristol, England. We decided to show our visiting UK team what Coloradans do for fun.

Colorado weather in the summer can be quite volatile, and that day was no exception. The trip began under sunny skies, but as we approached the river, dark clouds started rolling over the Rockies. Once we got the raft in the water, it started to rain. Before long, the situation escalated to a point where we feared for our lives. At least, that's how I remember it now. Heavy rain, hail, and lightning striking on both banks made the experience truly unforgettable.

These whitewater rafting adventures have taught me valuable lessons about life. Just like on the river, life can be unpredictable and sometimes filled with obstacles. It is essential to assess the risks and make decisions that align with our values and bring us joy. Navigating through both calm and turbulent waters strengthens the bonds we have with the people around us. Ultimately, these shared experiences shape our perspectives on life and help us grow as individuals.
