# Whitewater Rafting

Life is a lot like river rafting.  I've had several whitewater experiences that were each exciting and unique.  Each of them helped to shape my views on the process of life and the relationships with the people in the raft.


## Payette River


My first river running was when I was just 22.  I was fresh out of college and working at HP.  A group of engineers were working on planning a river run on the Payette River outside of Banks, Idaho.

Stacie was 5-months pregnant with our first daughter and we considered not going.  At that time we were inseparable and rarely did any activity apart from one another.  The river was mostly calm but with a mix of class 3 and class 4 rapids.  We decided to risk it, but the river can be unpredictable.

In the event, we did a stretch of river that contained a couple of class three rapids and a lot of calm floating.  Then we went higher up the river to catch one awesom class four series of rapids.  For this we left Stacie safely on shore.  Each person needed to decide if the danger was worth the thrill.  It totally was.


## Boise River


There is a small river that flows through downtown Boise.  It is perfect for innertubing.  Although the water is cold the current is calm and there is little whitewater.  You put in just south of town and float along the greenbelt of the city and get out at a city park.

We often floated on the river when we lived in Boise and enjoyed the experience.
We were visiting some friends several years after we had left.  We decided to float the Boise River with several young kids.  The kids when in the raft with Stacie while the rest of the adults went in innertubes. 

The one hazzard on the river is when the current takes you into the trees. Stacie had several tense moment being attacked by trees and the kids not helping with the paddling.  I don't think she had much fun that day but we all got through safely.


## Poudre River


The next trip was about nine years later, just west of Ft. Collins, Colorado.  The Poudre River was named by French trappers that hid gunpowder there back in the day.  This was another trip with coworkers.

At that time I was working on commercializing a research project based on the doctoral dissertation of a guy at HP Labs in Bristol, England. The team from the UK were visiting and we wanted to show them what Coloradans do for fun.

Colorado weather is often quite volatile in the summer and one never really knows... The trip started on a sunny morning but dark clouds were pouring over the Rockies.  

By the time we got the raft in the water it began to rain.  Soon we were fearing for our lives.  At least that how I recall it now.  Heavy rain, hail, and lightening striking on both banks made for a memorable experience.
