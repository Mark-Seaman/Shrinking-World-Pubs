# The Ultimate Adventure

## Introduction
It has been years since we have traveled internationally. Our last trip was a river cruise through Austria, Germany, and Netherlands in 2018. That trip was so wonderful that we we booked another river Cruise for 2020. Then the pandemic happened and it changed everything.

## A Shift in Perspective
My view of the inherent dangers of travel were filled with images of all that can go wrong. My desire to go abroad was overwhelm by the desire for self-protection. Adventure was traded for Safety. But five years later, I realize that I still have a desire for adventure. My remaining life should not be spent huddling in the safety and comfort of my home.

## The Questions
There are places in the world that I still want to visit. The questions then are ...
- Where to go?
- When to go?
- How long?
- How much?

## Dreams of Nafplio
Stacie and I were making plans to spend a month in Nafplio, Greece in the Peloponnese. We got as far as picking out an apartment online. This was the week that the pandemic started. Once again our plans were dashed.

## A Bold Idea
We have also fantasized about the idea of taking a repositioning cruise across the Atlantic. Many cruise ships spend winter in the Gulf of Mexico and summer in the Mediterranean or Baltic. These cruises are very cheap for the length of the time on ship and you still get to see a lot of port cities.

## Seizing the Opportunity
A few day ago we started investigating repositioning cruises. We found a really good deal on Holland America and booked the trip shortly after. Part 1 is a 14-day cruise which starts in Ft. Lauderdale and goes to Azores, Ireland, Britain, France, Belgium, Netherlands. Part 2 is another 14-day cruise on the same ship. This will take us to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Germany.

## The Grand Adventure
We will be gone for a month and visit twelve different countries. We will add eight new countries to our personal list. This truly is a chance in a lifetime for us. There is a certain luxury of freedom at this stage of life. We are excited about using that freedom to explore the world.

## Breaking the Work Cycle
This year has been consumed with work projects that were extremely demanding. Stacie and I have created a software application to register students for an online university. I have created an online school with classes on Software Engineer and Web Development. I am currently teaching these two at the university. It is necessary to break this cycle of overwork and the cruise seems like the solution.

## Two Parts for Convenience
I broke the cruise into two parts because many people might be able to take a 14-day cruise. Few people can break away for a month. Part 2 of the cruise starts and ends in Amsterdam. Interior cabins are only $1699/person at this time. This could end up being a cheap vacation.

## Join Our Adventure
We would love to share this experience with friends and would like you to consider being a part of our adventure. Life is short and friends make it more fun.
