# Life Is What Happens When You're Busy Making Other Plans

Write an article about the following ideas...

We think that the future is predictable

The reality is often quite different.

Recent event highlight this.

Stacie and I have been working on a software application since the beginning of this year.

The app is for a university, called Prometa, that has a doctoral program for theological education
of Spanish speakers.  

Headquartered in Costa Rica they have spanish speaking students around the world.

In order to grow they needed student registration software.

Stacie and I have been working on the app and it is ready for delivery.

Stacie was scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on Sunday to oversee the deployment and training on the 
enterprise application.

I am starting to teach on Monday and was not able to make the trip.

This morning (Friday) Stacie started having chest pains and I took her to the emergency room where
they ran tests.

The tests did not indicate a heart attack but more tests are indicated.

A recent routine CAT scan revealed there may be blockages and the cardiologist diagnosed her
with heart disease and at high risk.


Stacie has been admitted overnight and will have a stress test tomorrow morning this will inform
what we do next.

We are both relieved that this was reveal while she was still at home rather than overseas.
