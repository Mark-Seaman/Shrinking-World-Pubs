After seven years of teaching at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC), I am thrilled to announce my retirement. My journey at UNC's Monfort Business College began with a deep desire to train students in the skills that were often lacking in newly graduated engineers that I had previously hired during my decades of experience in the high-tech industry.

During my time at UNC, I had the privilege of instructing and guiding 433 students, delivering a total of 1,300 credit hours. Through these efforts, I contributed to a significant revenue generation of $2.6 million for UNC, assuming a rate of $2,000 per credit hour.

To equip students with the necessary skills to thrive in the rapidly evolving tech industry, I developed several courses. These courses included "Introduction to Web Development with HTML and CSS," "Intermediate Web Development with Python, Django, and PostGRES," and "Software Engineering Skills - a project-based approach." Creating a comprehensive course of this caliber typically demands around 1,000 hours of effort per course, resulting in a total investment of approximately 3,000 hours for these three courses alone.

In addition to developing these courses, I also taught 17 sections during my tenure at UNC. This encompassed not only classroom instruction but also lesson preparation, grading, and constant communication with my students. On average, each section required 150-250 hours of my time, equating to a total commitment of 2,600-4,250 hours.

Considering the immense dedication spent on course preparation and classroom teaching, I have devoted a staggering 6,000-7,000 hours over the course of my seven-year journey as an adjunct professor at UNC. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights into the current state of higher education and the dynamics of teaching.

Directly observing the progress of student learning has allowed me to refine my teaching techniques and optimize the rate at which students absorb the material. I have also developed effective methods for project-based and team-based learning, which I plan to implement in my courses at Shrinking World, the software and training company I founded in 2007 after retiring from HP. During my time at UNC, Shrinking World remained relatively dormant, but now I am excited to revitalize and expand it.

In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I have authored three textbooks and created three online courses. As I embark on this new chapter of my life, I eagerly look forward to writing more textbooks and building additional courses. My focus lies in teaching the skills necessary for individuals to thrive in the modern world, particularly in the realm of software development processes, technology, and leveraging generative AI for course creation and written content. Currently, I am working on several Seminars, which consist of one hour of video content, as well as Workshops, which comprise four hours of video content on these subjects. My goal is to produce a new Seminar each month and a Workshop each quarter.

Reflecting on my time at UNC, I am grateful for the formative and informative experiences it provided. The knowledge and insight gained will now enable me to serve a much broader audience through the expansion of Shrinking World and my ongoing pursuit of educational excellence.

In conclusion, my retirement from UNC marks the beginning of an exciting new phase in my career. I am deeply passionate about teaching skills that empower individuals to thrive in the modern world, and I am committed to creating impactful learning experiences through Shrinking World. With the knowledge and experience gained at UNC, I am confident that I can make an even greater impact on the world of education and beyond.
