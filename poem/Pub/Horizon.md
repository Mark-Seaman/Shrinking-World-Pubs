# The Horizon

by Mark Seaman

---

Church life is the horizon

Where Heaven meets Hell

Where God's glory meets Human brokenness

Where light meets darkness

Where mercy meets extremism

Of course, this would be a battleground between two kingdoms

But we know the eventual outcome

And we get a foretaste in church life of the coming age

God in us (fruit, gifts, healing, and glory)

Let us become God's people on earth

Where humility, compassion, and justice reign
