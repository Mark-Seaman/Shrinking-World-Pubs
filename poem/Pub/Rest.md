# A Place of Rest 
by Mark Seaman
---

There is a rest at the end of the journey. There is peace at the end of the struggle. When we've done our thing, when
we've had our say, then it is time to rest. I am reminded that this struggle will not go on forever. That the turmoil
and frustration will end. That the craziness of this world will not prevent us from our ultimate destiny.

Someday our body will turn to ash and it will planted in the earth or scattered in the wind. What happens to our body
will not count for much. But it does serve as a reminder that life is precious and must not be sqaundered.  Right now is
the only time that we are guaranteed.  Let's make it count.

People remember our deeds, the things that we did.  But far more they will remember that we loved well. They will
remember that our lives touched and that it was wonderful.  Though our spirit will live on our bodies will not.  There
is a finish line in the near future.  I will run my race for the prize that awaits.

There is an island that reminds me of this truth. I marvel at the setting sun, the pelicans floating by and the eagles
soaring high. As the sky is a mix of bright yellow and deep crimson over the island, I am reminded that each of us will
be ashes someday. And that the opportunity that we have to experience life in its fullest is right now.

Stacie's Island reminds me that there is resting place for each of us.
