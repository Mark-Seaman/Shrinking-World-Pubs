# Fruit that Lasts

by Mark Seaman

---

To All My Shepherds,
I raise a glass ... the Fruit of the Vine ... to fruit that lasts.

You  give Love to friends and enemies both inside and outside the church.

You bring Joy to those in sorrow even when you suffer.

You help others find Peace while you are anxious.

You show Patience toward those who criticize and complain.

You act in Kindness toward the weak and those in need.

Your Goodness puts the needs of others before your own.

You persevere with Faithfulness in difficult work without encouragement.

You respond to others with Gentleness and understanding.

Your Self-control holds you back when you want to explode.

Fruit grown in secret is revealed in due time for all the world to see.

God sees your selfless sacrifice.

On behalf of our King and all of his people thank you for being so fruitful.

You are deeply appreciated and the fruit you bear will last well into eternity.

Thank you for a fruitful life given to serve others.
