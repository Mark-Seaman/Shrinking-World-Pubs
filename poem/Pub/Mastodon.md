# Mastodon

Oh, have you heard of Mastodons,<br>
Those great big beasts with massive brawn?<br>
They roamed the land so long ago,<br>
A sight to see, oh don't you know!

With trunks so long and tusks so grand,<br>
They ruled the earth, a mighty band.<br>
Their shaggy fur and woolly hide,<br>
Could withstand the cold, no need to hide.

They ate the leaves from high up trees,<br>
And used their trunks to blow and sneeze.<br>
Their footsteps shook the very ground,<br>
A thunderous noise, oh what a sound!

But alas, the Mastodons are gone,<br>
No more to hear their ancient song.<br>
We'll remember them with awe and wonder,<br>
And honor their memory, never to sunder.

So let us learn from Mastodons,<br>
And cherish life while we're here, everyone.<br>
For time goes by in the blink of an eye,<br>
And we too shall one day say goodbye.
