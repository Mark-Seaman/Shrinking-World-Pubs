# Touched With Fire

by Mark Seaman

---

A Brilliant Madness -- Kay Redfield Jamison had it right.  

Years of research supported the inescapable conclusion: 

- Madness and Genius often occur together
- Evidence is seen throughout history and throughout career paths
- Poets, Painters, Generals, Emperors, Scientists, Writers
- Vincent Van Gogh, Lord Byron, Earnest Hemingway, Edgar Allen Poe, Robin Williams, 
Tennyson, Melville, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Schumann, Fitzgerald, Roberts 
Burns & Lowell, and a hundred more.

This conclusion is far from conclusive.

It presents far more questions than answers.

Which is the cause and which is the effect?

Does being mad give you a special insight into the unknown, unseen, and
misunderstood mysteries of the universe?

Does being a genius, and unlocking mysteries that no one else sees, drive one
mad?

Can I be brilliant without being mad, or mad without being brilliant?

Does the genetic code occasionally produce humans that burn with an internal
fire that few have?

Is the price of genius madness?  Or the gift of madness brilliance?

Are some, in their rise to new heights,  destined to suffer the fate of Icarus?

I will put such thoughts aside and soar to new heights, knowing that if I perish
it is because I too might have been touched with fire.
