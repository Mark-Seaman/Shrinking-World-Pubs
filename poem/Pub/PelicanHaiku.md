# Pelican Haiku
by Mark Seaman and ChatGPT

---

Pelican in flight,
Wings spread wide, gliding so free,
Graceful in the sky.

A fisherman's friend,
Pelican dives for the catch,
Feasting on the sea.

Sunrise on the beach,
Pelicans gather in flocks,
Greeting the new day.

Pelican takes flight,
Leaving footprints in the sand,
Echoes of the sea.
