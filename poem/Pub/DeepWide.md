# Deep and Wide

by Mark Seaman

---

May life be like a river that flows deep and wide

May I be the man that I want others to think that I am

May my actions, words, thoughts, and feelings always be in harmony

May I bring comfort to those who suffer

May I offer hope to those in despair

May I be an example of generosity

May I be quick to forgive and heal from my wounds

May I listen to truth

May I love well

The demands of reality push me beyond my capacity

May my spirit grow deeper and wider to fill the gap

From this trailhead I will hike all the way into eternity

And discover the source of depth and breadth itself

May the path be clear and I not fall along the way
