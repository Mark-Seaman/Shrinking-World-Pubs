# When Darkness Comes
by Mark Seaman

---

    God, You are My Father
    You gave life to every cell in my body
    You have guided my life through all my years
    You give my life integrity 
    A firm foundation to stand on, to build on

    When the shaking comes you don't move
    When negative emotions threaten
    You bring grace and redemption
    * For my Fear You teach Faith
    * For my Sadness You teach Hope
    * For my Shame You teach Love
    * For my Anger You teach Humility

    My foundation has integrity
    Faith, Hope, Love, Humility are my rock
    Fear, Sadness, Shame, Anger yield to grace
    Except by Your grace my house would fall
    Help me live true

    When darkness comes give me sight
    Fear, Sadness, Shame, Anger yield to grace
    Help me stand in the storm
    May Faith, Hope, Love, Humility rule my heart and mind
