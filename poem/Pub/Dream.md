# I Have a Dream

by Mark Seaman

---

I have a dream of people living in harmony.

The Spirit is stirring within each of us, desiring to bring transformation.

In my dream, we all act out of kindness and gentleness and compassion.

Humility replaces hostility and judgment.

Self-control takes precedence over controlling others through criticism and protest.

Humility replaces anger.

Faith replaces fear.

Hope replaces sadness and despair.

Love replaces shame and isolation.

In my dream, people follow God and are transformed to look like him.

I know this is a dream as I am shocked to awaken.

But then I reflect on the goodness that I have seen in the small band of 
those transformed by the living God.

It is already happening in places, in people, and in my time.

Let God's presence come!
