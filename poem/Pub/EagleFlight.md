# Flight of the Eagle

Oh, the places you'll go,<br>
If you follow your heart and let your dreams flow,<br>
You'll see sights you never knew existed,<br>
And make memories that will never be twisted.<br>

You'll climb mountains high and valleys low,<br>
And swim in oceans where the water glows,<br>
You'll meet creatures great and small,<br>
And learn things that will astound you all.<br>

You'll taste foods that will make your taste buds dance,<br>
And hear music that will make your heart prance,<br>
You'll smell flowers that are sweet as can be,<br>
And touch things that are as soft as a baby's knee.<br>

So go out there and explore,<br>
Let your spirit soar,<br>
There's a whole world out there waiting for you,<br>
Just be brave and see what you can do.<br>

And when you're tired and ready to rest,<br>
Just remember that you did your best,<br>
You saw things that many never see,<br>
And made memories that will forever be.<br>

So go out there and make your mark,<br>
And when it's over, know that you left a spark,<br>
Of joy and wonder that will live on,<br>
In the hearts of those whose lives you shone.<br>
