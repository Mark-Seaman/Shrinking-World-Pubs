# Transactions with Others

by Mark Seaman

---

There are two forms of motivation that may apply to all transactions with others.


### Business


In this mindset we serve others to create something for ourselves. 

We produce good value for the client, church, spouse, or child because we know about karma.

We seek to create a sustainable lifestyle, organization, family, church, or company.

The only way to do this is to serve well and build trust.

This ethic seeks to maximize my long-term well being.



### Ministry


In this mindset we serve others to create something for them. 

We produce good value for the client, church, spouse, or child because we care about them more than us.

We seek to create a good life for others.

The only way to do this is to serve well and make sacrifices as needed.

This ethic seeks to maximize their long-term well being while not destroying our own.



### Finding Balance


We all operate in both these way but have a clear preference for one.

Health is found in a balance between give and take.

Business and Ministry are both important.

When neglected we all suffer.

We do not have to choose between Tycoon or Martyr.

Build for sustainability and serve others well.

Move back and forth on the pendulum to find the right pitch for now.
