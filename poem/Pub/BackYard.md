# My Back Yard

by Mark Seaman

---

I got up this morning and found a bald eagle in my back yard.

There were also six pelicans and five cormorants.

A blue heron walked along the shore bobbing its head while hunting for fish.

Ten red-winged blackbirds flitted about on the trees while a squirrel annoyed them. 

Fish leave the water briefly in search of bugs only to return to their underwater domain.

The eagle casts a shadow while looking for breakfast.

My back yard is a lake teaming with life and activity.

Nature is still happening on the earth, and life is truly good.
