# After the Coma

by Mark Seaman

---

2020 has been an extraordinarily difficult year for me.  Everything that could be shaken has been, so that only that which cannot be shaken remains.  This pruning process has been deep and personal.  It has gone to the core of who I am.

Throughout 2020 it felt like darkness was growing in my spirit and the world around me.  Things that I had clung to as sources of hope finally failed me. I would have to characterize the descent into despair as the dark night of the soul.  I realized that I had lost all hope for the future.

The last few weeks have brought me new hope.  I now believe that restoration is coming.  I believe that all of the pain has  produced new insight. 

I have been almost completely silent for the last year because I felt that I had nothing to say. As I awake from my coma I feel that a remarkable transformation has occurred.   The world looks strangely different ... hopeful and bright. Joy comes in the morning.

The lament will continue for what has been lost.  Grief is an essential step toward emotional health. But there is more to life than grief.  Hope, Joy, and Peace also pull me forward.

2020 was a year of survival.  Getting through the experiences of social and political and environmental breakdown has been a serious challenge.  I have been held in the grip of perpetual shock for most of the year.

Now I am ready to speak out.   We each have a voice and a role to play in the coming story.  I am ready to commit my time, energy, and resources to the difficult tasks of rebuilding. 

We have lost so much but what we are about to build together will be far better than what existed before.  Join me in this important task of building a better world. 2021 will be a year of moving forward.   I feel it in my bones.
