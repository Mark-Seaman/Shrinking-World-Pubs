# Born for This

by Mark Seaman

**Destiny** calls and I respond

No one can choose the **Time** they **Live** in

But all can choose to live **True** to their **Times**

Living true means giving my **Whole Self** to the challenge presented 

The **Spirit of the Times** must be answered

The **Challenger** stirs within me

The **Rebel** awakens

I will seek to **Right the Wrongs**

I will oppose the **Power** that **Oppresses** the **Weak**

**Destiny** calls and I respond
