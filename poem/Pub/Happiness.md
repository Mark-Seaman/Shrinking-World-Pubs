I have violated these most of my life because I did not believe they were real.


* I control myself, but cannot control others.
* Managing emotions is essential to happiness.
* An attitude of gratitude is the key to contentment.
* Simplify the goal to focus on the important things.
* Live in the moment, tomorrow is gone, the future is not yet.
* Distinguish between needs and wants.
* Generosity produces trust.
