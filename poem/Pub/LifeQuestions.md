# Life's Greatest Questions

by Mark Seaman

---

As a youth I ask, "Who am I and how do I fit in?"

As a young adult I ask, "What can I do (power), and how can I win (success)?"

In middle age I ask, "What is my purpose and how can I be fulfilled?"

In old age I ask, "What will I leave behind and how will I be remembered?"

At every life stage I ask, "How can I get my way?"

At every life stage I ask, "What am I willing to give?"

How we answer will dictate how we live.
