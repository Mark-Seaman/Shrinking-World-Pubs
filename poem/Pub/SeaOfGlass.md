# Sea of Glass

by Mark Seaman

---

The lake is a sea of glass

The mountains loom above and below

Fish jump and eagles soar

So my spirit jumps and soars

There is still beauty

This is a place of peace

The day is warm and cool

The air is still and breezy

I am reminded that life is good

The smell of the pines

The aroma of the flowers

Carries me far away to right here

I experience a perfect moment before returning to real life

Then I remember that this too is a part of my life

I tuck it away in my heart for later
