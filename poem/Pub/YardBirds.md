# A Yard Full of Birds

by Mark Seaman and ChatGPT

---

In your back yard, what do you see? <br>
An eagle, a heron, a pelican, and a cormorant, looking at me.

The eagle is proud, with feathers so grand, <br>
His sharp talons and keen eyesight are just in demand.

The heron is tall, with a neck long and thin, <br>
He wades through the water with a graceful spin.

The pelican is funny, with a beak like a scoop, <br>
He dives for fish and always brings home the soup.

The cormorant is sleek, with feathers dark and smooth, <br>
He dives deep and catches fish with his groove.

Each bird is unique, with its own special flair, <br>
They're all different, but they all have a care.

For the water they share, and the land they call home, <br>
They live in harmony, and they never do roam.

They perch on branches and take to the sky, <br>
And always watch out with a sharp eagle eye.

In your back yard, these birds will be found, <br>
And they'll always be there, with their wings spread around.

So cherish these creatures, both great and small, <br>
And always remember, they make our world whole.
