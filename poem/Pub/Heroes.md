# What Makes a Hero?

by Mark Seaman

---

I listed my heroes from every age.

I pondered them and they have taught me about life.

I extracted the essence that makes them heroic.

These are the aspects that I wish for in my own life.

- Personal sacrifice
- Courage
- Counter cultural
- Speak truth to power
- Influence
- Resiliency and perseverance 
- Personal integrity

Heroes teach me what is true.

They stand with the weak and helpless against the rich and powerful.

They fight against the oppressors on behalf of the oppressed.

The appear in every age and serve the needs at hand.

They know that the sacrifice they make is worthwhile.

My heroes are Warriors and Peacemakers, Scientists and Inventors, 
Spiritual leaders and Artists.

A hero overcomes the evil of the time in which they live and leave a lasting 
legacy for all.

We need heroes for our time and place.
