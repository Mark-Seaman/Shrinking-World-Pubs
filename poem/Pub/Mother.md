# What is a Mother?

by Mark Seaman

What is in a Mothers Heart?

- Enough **LOVE** to dispense for every situation
- Enough **JOY** to get through all the craziness
- Enough **PEACE** to be calm when the chaos threatens to panic
- Enough **PATIENCE** to defer personal desires for the benefit of others
- Enough **KINDNESS** to empathize when people are being ugly
- Enough **GOODNESS** to invest your life in others
- Enough **FAITHFULNESS** to be fruitful on the bad days
- Enough **GENTLENESS** to bring healing by listening
- Enough **SELF-CONTROL** to do the hard thing well

A Mother's Heart must have Supernatural Power to Bear Fruit that emanates from the Throne of God.

Every Mother may receive this Power and become a Beacon of Hope.

May this River of Life refresh each Mother's Heart.

May all of us HONOR the Mothers that are a part of Our Story.
