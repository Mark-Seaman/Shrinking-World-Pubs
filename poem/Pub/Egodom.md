# My Kingdom Come

by Mark Seaman

---

I founded my own kingdom, called Egodom.

Here I am king, emperor, and God.

My only problem seems to be getting others to acknowledge my right to rule.

It appears that nine billion others have had a similar idea.

The rules of my kingdom are simple:  I get all that I want, when I want it, all the time.

People are used for my gain; the goal is always more.

I can not be successful by myself - I need allies.

Every interaction is an opportunity to find allies that make me powerful. Better together.

My archenemy is God, since he founded his own kingdom to claim all things for himself.

His rules are also simple: He gets all things, when he wants it, all the time.

He demands complete allegiance of all subjects as do I.

Fortunately, I have dual citizenship in both kingdoms. 

As a citizen of Egodom, I work to get my way and in the kingdom of God I work for his glory.

I move across the border freely - no one knows when I switch my loyalty.  I am very careful to keep
my secret safe.

This often leads to conflicts, because the values, beliefs, and priorities of the kingdoms are so
different.

Every day I function in both kingdoms and I tell myself that I must eventually choose.

Perhaps someday I will.  But today I will protect my dual citizenship and live with the tension.
