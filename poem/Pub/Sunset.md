# Sunset
by Mark Seaman

---

As the sun sets over the mountains I remember Your love.
As the sunset colors fill the evening sky I am reminded that life is beautiful.

As the day draws to an end I contemplate all that has happened.
The stress of unfulfilled dreams and unresolved conflict weigh heavily.

As the sun sets over the mountains I remember  Your love.
As the sunset colors fill the evening sky I am reminded that life is beautiful.

Today is completely different than yesterday.
Today is just the same as yesterday with no end in sight.

As the sun sets over the mountains I remember  Your love.
As the sunset colors fill the evening sky I am reminded that life is beautiful.

As I think about the long night ahead a gnawing anxiety comes to call.
Fear threatens to steal my joy and despair growls in the growing darkness.

As the sun sets over the mountains I remember  Your love.
As the sunset colors fill the evening sky I am reminded that life is beautiful.

Even though the night may come Your strength will see me through.
Especially when the unthinkable happens I will seek comfort in You.

As the sun sets over the mountains I remember  Your love.
As the sunset colors fill the evening sky I am reminded that life is beautiful.
