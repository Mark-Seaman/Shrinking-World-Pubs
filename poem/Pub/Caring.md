# Caring Brings Healing

by Mark Seaman

---

All people have a deep need to connect with others.

Our human nature longs to be loved and to love.

The difference between a river and a pool is the movement of the water.

Many of us want to receive love without giving any in return.

I have observed thousands of Christ followers over the years.

I have never seen anyone get healing for the soul without being willing to love others.

Giving love is a means to receiving love.

Yes, it is risky; you might be hurt.

But you will also be hurt if you choose not to love.

The path of isolation and selfishness is not the safe path at all.

What can you do this week to give your love to someone else?

The Spirit is at work; what is he inviting you to do?
