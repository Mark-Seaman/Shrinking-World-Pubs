# Community of Kindness

by Mark Seaman

---

Kindness is one of the things that characterize the true followers of Jesus.  

It is human nature to be selfish.

It is God's nature to be given.

One of the things I love most about our church is the desire to care for those in need.

The food pantry illustrates this desire at a church level.

It reflects a deep desire by our leaders to love our community.

This is awesome for a church to do, but this can also be made personal.

What is one idea for kindness that you could do this week?

How can you express God's love to someone this week?

Please share your story to inspire all of us to greater acts of kindness?
