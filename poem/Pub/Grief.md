# Learning to Grieve

by Mark Seaman

---


Grief is essential to spiritual growth.

Loss is unavoidable if you are human.

Pain is a great teacher, of lessons that we need but do not want.

It is impossible to mature without embracing loss and learning from it.

Loss is inevitable but learning is not.

God uses painful experiences to his glory and our benefit.

We build memorials to process grief.

Memorials are a reminder of things easily forgotten.

Reminders of our vulnerability cause us to remain humble and seek a better life.

Reminders of God's love allow us to fully embrace the joys of life.

Reminders of purpose help us understand why we walk this earth.

Grief is essential to spiritual growth.
