# Mansplaining

**Mansplaining**: That's where someone talks down to you while explaining some simple term.

Although technically available to either sex, it carries true legitimacy from the male of the species.

**Mansplaining**: That's where someone reasserts their dominance.

You should accept my superiority long enough to hear my explanation then I may let you talk.

**Mansplaining**: That's where someone shows you that they know more than you do.

Of course your opinions matter as well, and eventually I may pause to find out.

**Mansplaining**: That's where someone reveals that you have lesser value.

Listening requires openness and empathy - to be more human - to be more than right.

Listening requires humility!
