# Rise of Empire

by Mark Seaman

---

Humans band together - it is inevitable.

How else can we gain control and assert dominance?

We are driven to have our way.

From the smallest to the greatest the drive is on ...

First the family,
then the clan,
then the tribe,
then the town,
then the city,
then the state,
then the nation,
then the empire,
then the global superpower.

Wealth and power are both the means and the end.

With each acquisition, we grow bolder.

Our ambitions rise well beyond our reach, so we reach with greater passion.

We will not stop until we rule the world or are limited by others.

We are human and this is only natural.

We will be God and all will pay homage.
