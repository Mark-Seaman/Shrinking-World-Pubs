# The Beauty and the Beast

by Mark Seaman

---

What does it mean to be human?

There are many metaphors used to describe our dual nature.


## Dark Side

- **The Beast** - We are animals that are driven by insatiable appetites for wealth and power.  Our self
  interest is seldom enlightened and frequently carries us into disaster.  We care little for the
  welfare of others until it impinges on our own.  We use all our resources to dominate and
  subjugate.
- **Demonic** - We lust for power and often use supernatural means to attempt to gain control of the
  world around us.  We use religious language and institutions to enforce our will and control the
  people in our lives.  
- **Sinner** - We are prone to commit unspeakable acts of violence when all else fails.  We often
  masquerade our intensions as being holy to gain followers and hide our true intent.  We lie,
  steal, and murder to get what we want.
- **Hater** - We care for people that we deem worthy, but would willingly exterminate those whom we
  fear, if given a chance.  We actively support injustice and genocide if it advances our goals,
  despite the suffering it causes.


## Light Side

- **Beauty** - We are created in the image of God and are works of beauty.  We are spiritual beings that
  will live forever.  We are the highest of created beings in the universe.
- **Divine** - We have a spirit that possesses the divine nature of God.  We long for truth, justice,
  and beauty.  We seek to live our lives in purity and consistency with the will of God.
- **Saint** - We are deeply disturbed when evil triumphs and would gladly sacrifice our lives to bring
  redemption.  We fight injustice and seek to make the world better in every way.
- **Lover** - We are passionate lovers, looking for reconciliation and peace.  We hope in the future and
  trust others to see it come to pass.


## Two Beings

The dual nature of humans shows up everywhere: family, communities, nations, churches, businesses,
and schools.

How can this be?

- Beast and Beauty
- Demonic and Divine
- Sinner and Saint
- Hater and Lover

Two beings in one body.  Welcome to the human race!
