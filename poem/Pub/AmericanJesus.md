# American Jesus

by Mark Seaman

---

The latest in a long line of false gods...

**Jewish Messiah** rescues us from the Romans and enforces the rule of the Pharisees

**Kingdom of Heaven** Jesus obliterates the infidels in the Holy Land

**Holy Roman Empire Jesus** consolidates the empire and brings us victory and death to the barbarians

**Reformation Jesus**  defeats the armies of the Pope and brings us Protestants to power

**Inquisition Jesus** destroys the heretics and their teachings bringing loyalty to the Church

**British Imperial Jesus** protects our commercial interests world wide, allowing complete cultural domination

**Confederate Jesus** crusades for States Rights to own slaves and overcome Yankee oppression

**Apartheid Jesus** gives us the right to oppress others and justifies our prejudice

**American Jesus** promises abundant life for the faithful and misery for everyone else

**Biblical Jesus** is so unlike any of these caricatures and mascots for our own glory
