# Gift of Today

by Mark Seaman

---

Each day is a gift.

I will embrace it for what it is.

Even though I have expectations - today will surprise me.

Sudden joy may delight me.

Sudden sorrow may befall me.

Whether joy or sorrow, I will seek to embrace it and let it do its work in me.

My creator is on overwatch and somehow everything will work out OK.

The certainty that I feel is simply an illusion of control.

I am addicted to control on performance.

But in solitude and silence I know that life itself is beyond my control.

Peace is found in surrender and acceptance of life as it comes.

Each day is a gift.
