# Hour of Bliss

by Mark Seaman

---

In a world of dreams, I find my way,
At the break of dawn, a brand new day.
No judgment here, just pure delight,
In the most important hour, I take flight!

Fresh mental energy, it's a treasure to hold,
As the night's dreams in my mind unfold.
With unfettered ideation, I freely explore,
In the land of ideas, I truly adore.

No self-control, no need to restrain,
In this precious hour, there's nothing to gain.
No pleasing others, no need to conform,
Just the bliss of creativity, in its purest form.

Ideas spring forth, like flowers in spring,
In the most important hour, I let them all sing.
With no limits, my imagination takes flight,
Oh, what a wondrous, creative delight!

So cherish that hour, when the day is still young,
In the world of dreams, where you've just begun.
Let your ideas flow, let your spirit soar,
In that blissful hour, where creativity pours!
