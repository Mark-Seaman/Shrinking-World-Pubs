# Seasons

    Seasons come and seasons go
    Rain, Sun, Leaves, and Snow

    The world orbits the sun and tilts on its axis
    Creating inevitable yet predictable change
    And yet the seasons are filled with surprise
    Will it be a hot summer or a cold winter?
    Even the trend will not fully yield its power
    It defies our desire to control or predict

    Seasons come and seasons go
    Rain, Sun, Leaves, and Snow

    Our lives orbit the world we live in and cause us to tilt
    Creating inevitable yet predictable change
    And yet the seasons are filled with surprise
    Will it be a volatile youth or a bitter aging?
    Even the trend will not fully yield its power
    It defies our desire to control or predict

    Seasons come and seasons go
    Rain, Sun, Leaves, and Snow

    Youth, Adult, Mid-life, Senior
    Longing for Belonging
    Driven to Succeed
    Questioning the Purpose of it all
    Seeking Enlightenment

    Life has a pattern
    But the pattern does not prevent surprise
    It defies our desire to control or predict

    Seasons come and seasons go
    Rain, Sun, Leaves, and Snow
