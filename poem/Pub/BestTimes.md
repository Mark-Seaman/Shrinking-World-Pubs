# Days We Live

by Mark Seaman and Chuck Dickens

---

It was the best of times, 
it was the worst of times, 

it was the age of wisdom, 
it was the age of foolishness, 

it was the era of law and order, 
it was the era of anarchy, 

it was the season of Light, 
it was the season of Darkness, 

it was the spring of hope, 
it was the winter of despair, 

we had everything before us, 
we had nothing before us, 

we were all destined for Heaven, 
we were all destined for Hell,

in short, it was just like today, 
where those in control take the place of God,

where restraint is something for the weak and poor,
where wealth is used to buy justice,

we have come to the limit of ourselves,
we have peered into oblivion.

What will our next step be?
