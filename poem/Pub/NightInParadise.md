# A Night in Paradise

by Mark Seaman

---

I can't sleep<br>
The waves are roaring<br>
Making their repeated assault on the lava rock

There are no surfers now <br>
But tomorrow they will appear with the sunrise

Too bad I will not be here to see it<br>
I will be gone before the sun visits this place again

The sun melts into the ocean<br>
As our plane touches the runway 

It seems such a brief moment to be in paradise<br>
A quick passing of bliss before the long journey

I should be sleeping to save energy for the long voyage<br>
But the waves call me out

As I peer down from my penthouse suite<br>
I marvel at what I see in the dark

The morning light reveal more<br>
But I will be long gone by then

There are whales slumbering offshore<br>
I know because I have seen then before

The sound of the waves brings joy<br>
My spirit leaps with each crescendo

The sound of the waves brings sadness<br>
There are no waves where I am going

Palms wave in the night breeze<br>
Bidding me on my journey

I would love to stay here and see this place in the light<br>
But it cannot be

This place is just a stopover on a longer journey<br>
A piece of paradise I will carry with me

A part of myself I leave in paradise<br>
Now is a gift received and I am ready to move on

I can mourn that I have just this night<br>
I can celebrate that I have just this night<br>
I will do both

I can't sleep<br>
The waves are roaring
