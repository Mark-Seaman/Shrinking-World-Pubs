# Never a Straight Line

by Mark Seaman

---

We assume that life is an orderly march toward success.

Sometimes it is, re-enforcing the illusion that we are in control.

Then ... wham!

This could not happen; this was not in the five-year plan.

This will change my life.   Certainly and definitely.

Sometimes our life will change in ways that we intend.  

At other times we struggle to understand how life can be, now, after this.

Profound sorrow and profound joy often mix in this strange thing called life.

Riding the emotional roller coaster is inevitable.  Once it starts there is no getting off until the end of the ride.

Welcome to the human race!
