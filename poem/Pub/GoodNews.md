# Good News for Some

by Mark Seaman

---

The Gospel is touted as being the Good News.

Is it really?

If you are sick it is certainly good news that God heals.

If you are weak and vulnerable it is good news that God gives strength.

If you are broke  it is good news that God provides.

If you are in prison it is good news that God sets captives free.

If you are oppressed it is good news that God fights for you.

If you are have no voice it is good news that God give you one.

If you are  an alien it is good news that God gives everyone a home.

Is it good news for the rich and powerful?

If your livelihood is built on the misery of others is the Gospel really Good News?

If you live a life of privilege and comfort at the expense of others is it good news?

If you rely on injustice to retain power is it good news?

If you must deny votes to stay in power is it good news?

If you exploit workers to make more money is it good news?

If you are a white supremacist is it good news?

If your reality is built on lies is it good news?

If your fragile world is about to end is it good news?

---

The kingdom of God comes to bring release from oppression and injustice.

For many this is extremely Bad News.

For others this is indeed Good News.
