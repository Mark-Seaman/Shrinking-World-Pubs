# Grocery Challenge

by Mark Seaman

---

I love being a part of a church that provides food to those who need it.

This can be made personal.

Who do you know that could use some groceries?

We all regularly buy groceries for our families.

What if you buy an extra bag this week?

Who could use some extra food and a boost of love?

One act of kindness could change their life; it could change your life.

We do not have to way for a program to do God's work; every act of kindness is spiritual.

Give love to receive love.

Expect nothing in return and reap a unexpected harvest.
