# Control Issues

by Mark Seaman

---

There are things that I can control.

There are things that I cannot control.

I need wisdom to know the difference.

I control what I do.

I control what I say.

I control what I think.

I control what I feel.

I don't control what others do.

I don't control what others say.

I don't control what others think.

I don't control what others feel.

I must take full responsibility for what I do, say, think, and feel.

I must accept as reality what others do, say, think, and feel.

Maturity is defined by how well I walk in this truth .
