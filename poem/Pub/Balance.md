# The Balance

by Mark Seaman

---

I had a dream.

There was a cosmic balance.

Five men step onto the right side of the scale.

Zuck, Musk, Bezos, Gates, Buffet.

On the left side we have the poor and despised - wretched refuse from our teaming shores.

The Capitalist believes that wealth tracks contribution.

I was eager to see the relative contribution.

People begin to step to the left.

Suffering families with impoverished kids.

People rejected from decent society.

The loading of the scale begins.

One thousand families can not tip the scale.

Ten thousand family can not tip the scale.

One hundred thousand families can not tip it.

One million family can not bring the balance.

The march continues to find the tipping point.

The Capitalist believes that wealth tracks contribution.

I am curious to see the fate of humanity.

How many people will tip the scale?

Separating humanity - Poor on the Left, Rich on the Right.

The loading of scale continues.

When will it tip?

On the left people cry for justice.

On the right people cry for freedom from regulation and government interference.

Both are viewed as legitimate.

It's the same for the rich and poor.

Zuck and Musk fight for free speech.

Bezos fights the unions to hold labor cost.

While the masses fight for food, education, and healthcare.

We all applaud the fight for freedom.

The loading of scale continues.

The suffering hoard steps onto the left scale.

Two million.

Three million.

Four million.

Five million.

Six million.

Ten million.

Still the scale will not balance.

Perhaps the right side is too heavy at 700 billion.

Twenty million.

Thirty million.

Forty million.

Fifty million.

Sixty million.

One hundred million suffering Americans.

Still the scale will not balance.

The Capitalist states that wealth tracks contribution.

One hundred and twenty million.

One hundred and forty million.

One hundred and sixty million.

One hundred and eighty million.

Two hundred and ten million.

The Capitalist states that wealth tracks contribution.

Are the lives of five men worth the lives of 210,000,000?

It make me question capitalism.

I startle awake and am grateful to be in a world that makes sense again.
