# First Day of Class

by Mark Seaman

---

I've never been here before: new place, new teacher, new students, new subjects.

Yet I have been here before: old place, old teacher, old students, old subjects.

What is old becomes new and what is new is very like the old.

Anticipation of the pleasant surprises.

Fear of the unknown.

I've been here before it is all routine.

Yet, I'm entering uncharted territory ... I quickly check my charts for directions.

My students are eager to learn - that's what I tell myself.

This year is a fresh start - that's what I tell myself.

I will not make past mistakes, I will make new ones.

Today presents a new opportunity to inspire, lead, and serve.

You can lead a student to knowledge, but you can't make them think!

Learning is a choice.  To learn is to choose life.

First day of class - so much promise.
