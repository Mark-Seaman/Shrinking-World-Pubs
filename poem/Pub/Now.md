# Living My Now

by Mark Seaman

---

The **PAST** calls to me.

Like the sirens' call beckoning me backward.

The draw of glories lost and regrets not forgotten.

The feeling of loss can bring a deep sadness.

If fully embraced the path leads to the despair of self-pity.

---

The **FUTURE** calls to me.

Like the sirens' call beckoning me forward.

The draw of imagined glories that are beyond my grasp.

The feeling of anxiety turns to a gripping fear.

If fully embraced the path leads to dread and panic.

---

The **PRESENT** calls to me.

Love, Joy, and Peace live in the **NOW**.

I choose to be fully alive right **NOW**.

I will trade the Sadness of the Past for the Joy of **NOW**.

I will trade the Fear of the Future for the Peace of **NOW**.

As I become **AWARE** of myself and others, I touch **ETERNITY**.

I choose to be fully alive right **NOW**.
