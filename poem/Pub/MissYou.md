# I Miss You

by Mark Seaman

---

    I miss your quirky smile.
    I miss how you would make others laugh. 

    I miss how you would brighten a room when you entered.
    I miss your crazy comments and your outrageous sense of humor.

    I miss the disagreements that we had. 
    I miss how we would make up and grow closer in understanding . 

    I miss your stubbornness and obstinance.
    I miss being stubborn and obstinate with you.

    I miss our misunderstandings. 
    I miss the joy of reaching new levels of understanding with you.

    I miss the intimacy of solitude with you. 
    I miss knowing what you will say next.

    I miss seeing your brokenness and loving you.
    I miss you seeing my brokenness and being loved.

    I miss the good times we had. 
    I miss the bad times we had.

    Your life made mine fuller.
    Your life made mine richer.
    Your life made mine better. 

    I will never forget what you taught to me.
    I will never lose what you gave to me.

    I will seek to live a better life with your example.
    I will look forward to when we meet again.
