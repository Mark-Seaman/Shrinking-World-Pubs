# Transformed by Love

by Mark Seaman

---

There is no greater power on earth.

Humans are selfish; God is not.

We love because we are able to receive love.

Those who cannot receive love have little to give.

They become a pool rather than a river.

Be a river; receive the unlimited love of God.

Then you will be a conduit of that love to the world.

True love is impossible to counterfeit.

It transforms everything.

It is the work of the Spirit.

- Kindness
- Gentleness
- Patience
- Self-control and restraint
- Harmony and peace
- Perseverance and faithfulness 
- Pure motives from goodness  
- Gratitude and deep joy

We all long for these things, but selfishness takes all.

Many times each day we must choose - love or selfishness.

Choose this day - Life or Death
