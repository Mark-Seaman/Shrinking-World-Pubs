# The Best of Us

by Mark Seaman

What makes life worth living?<br>
It is not accomplishments or goals or achievements.<br>
It is more about Being than Doing.<br>

A life worth living is filled with love, joy, and peace.<br>
A virtuous person is good and faithful, controlling themselves but not others.<br>
Their interactions are patient, kind, and gentle.<br>

Within every human, a war rages between the best of us and the worst of us.<br>
What we yield to changes our future path and over time we become more of what we are already.<br>

For a lifetime now, I have observed people.<br>
I've seen the best of us and the worst of us.<br>
More than anyone I have ever known, Stacie showed us how to live and demonstrated life by her example.<br>

She was truly the best of us!<br>
