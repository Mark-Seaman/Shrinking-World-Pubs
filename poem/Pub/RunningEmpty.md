# Running on Empty

by Mark Seaman

---

There is nothing but fumes in the tank but I'm not going to stop for gas.

Only weaklings pull off the highway before they reach the destination.

But not me … pedal to the metal … full speed ahead.

I have a "can do" attitude and always give 110%.

When I'm injured I just walk it off. 

I refuse to acknowledge pain since that will only slow me down.

Nothing can harm me — I am invincible.

Others take time to reflect and recharge but this is a luxury that I could never afford.

I'm doing important, critical, vital, crucial, and pivotal things.

And lots of them, certainly more than anyone else.  I wonder why others do so little.

I am already so busy with all of the business, and busy buzzing.

I never let up and feel like I'm moving 100 miles per hour.

Then I hit the wall … fade to black.
