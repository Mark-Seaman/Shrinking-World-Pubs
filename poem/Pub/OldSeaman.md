# The Old Seaman

by Mark Seaman

---

The Old Seaman stood on the shore and gazed across the water without really seeing.<br>
Sun shining, palms waving in the warm breeze.

He pondered where life had taken him and the adventures that he had experienced.<br>
He thought about what life had taught him on the way.

From the race horse farms of Kentucky to the sheep farm of Northern Canada,<br>
The cattle ranches of Colorado and South Dakota, where raw steaks are grown.

From the bustling city of Athens, once the birthplace of civilization,<br>
To the Jordanian tombs of Petra, he was witness to the rise and fall of civilizations.

From the parade grounds of Nuremberg to the Roman Forum,<br>
He had visited the birthplace of death and the domination of empires.

But today was not the time for such brooding,<br>
The natural beauty brought his attention to the present.

The mountain of the next island loomed above the clouds.<br>
Whales announced their presence with water spouts before extending their flutes in a friendly wave.

The Old Seaman stood on the shore and reveled at the goodness of life.<br>
Moments of joy and ecstasy. 

This moment is to be recorded forever,<br>
A new happy place to be a refuge in times of distress.

The Seaman stared across the water and thought about the future.<br>
He had a tendency toward fear, as an engineer, always looking for problems to solve.

Even in paradise, threat lurks everywhere.<br>
It gnaws at his sense of security and nibbles at his confidence.

Each imagined calamity seems possible and then likely to overtake him.<br>
The four horsemen ride again: Slavery, Famine, Disease, War

The horseman shall not ride on this day. They shall not have this moment.<br>
Perhaps some day tragedy may strike, but today is not that day.

The Seaman turned from the abyss to celebrate the goodness of God.<br>
The darkness is vanquished as quickly as it appeared.

In this place it is easy to imagine a brighter world.
