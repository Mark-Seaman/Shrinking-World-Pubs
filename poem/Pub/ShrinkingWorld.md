500 years ago - No human had been Around the World

200 years ago - No one had ever Phoned Home

100 years ago - There were no Movies or Jets

50 years ago - There were no Personal Computers or Space Travel

30  years ago - There was no World Wide Web

20 years ago - There were no Smart Phones

10 years ago - There was no Global Supply Chain Crisis

5 years ago - There was no need to worry about the possibility human extinction

Today - We must work together because our survival depends on it.

Welcome to the Shrinking World!

While you are here you will depend on the other 10 billion people for your well-being.

Let's be good to one another.
