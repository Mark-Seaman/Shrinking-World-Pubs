# Two Invitations

by Mark Seaman

---

The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come and Dine."

The Church and State say, "Kiss the Ring."

The Son says, "Abundant Life and Freedom."

The Empire says, "Kneel or Die."

The Father says, "Truth brings Freedom."

The Religious Leaders say, "Repent and Submit."

God searches for Lost Souls.

The Authorities search for Evil Rebels.

I have received two invitations.

I wonder which I should accept, as they seem so similar.
