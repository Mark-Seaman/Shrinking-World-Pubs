# Morning Coffee

by Mark Seaman

---

The SMELL, the TASTE, the WARMTH.

Life is good again.

Yesterday is gone and a new day beckons me.

The restless night has been swallowed by the dawn.

I am still.  I am at peace.

The SMELL, the TASTE, the WARMTH.

I savor the moment.

This may be the calm before the storm.

Life is good and I am content.

A new day awaits with unknown experiences.

The SMELL, the TASTE, the WARMTH.

I take another sip and breathe deeply.

Yesterday had its special sorrows and joys.

The sorrow teaches and the joy motivates.

I am ready to face today.
