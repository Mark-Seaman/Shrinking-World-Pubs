# The Night We Met

by Mark Seaman

---

Thinking back on that first night, it is amazing that we ever hit it off. Who would think that I 
could overlook such a rocky start and learn to love you so much.

They say that first impressions are the most important, but I have not allowed that first awkward 
meeting to define my image of you.

First off, you showed up late. I waited patiently in the place where the meeting was supposed to 
happen.  I had been up all night expecting you to show.  

I had a sense that there was a lot at stake and that potentially life-and-death issues were at play.  
The whole thing made me nervous from the start.

I started to wonder if you would ever show or if I should write it all off as a joke.  When you did 
arrive you made no apology but instead screamed at everyone in the room. 

When you showed up, you put another woman that I love through a great deal of pain.  That also 
caused me pain, but I'm willing to forgive you for that.

Our first encounter is the most shocking moment of my entire life. To this day, it has left me 
altered in a way that few other events have.

Your appearance was the most jolting part of all of it.  You came in without clothes and 
looked like you were wearing makeup from a low-grade horror movie.

The Dr gave me a pair of shears and told me to sever an organ that was the only connection between 
you and your mother. After performing the gruesome act there was no return for anyone.

None of us would ever be the same.  None of us would ever speak of this moment, for no human 
alive had ever been involved in such a bizarre and primitive experience as this.  Surely, this 
is not normal.  It can't be!
