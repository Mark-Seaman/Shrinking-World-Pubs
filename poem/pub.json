    "description": "What is poetry?\u00a0 While prose seeks to enlighten, poetry seeks to inspire.\u00a0\nAuthors speak the language of the head, but poets speak the language of the\nheart and the gut.\u00a0 Words of logic are no match for words of passion.\n\nTwo views of reality ... one of the waking world ... one of the dream world. \nThe world is filled with issues of politics, economics, survival, and conflict.\nIn this domain the laws of science rule.\u00a0 Cause and Effect, Quantum Mechanics,\nand Entropy.\u00a0 Logic is king and every problem has a solution.\n\nBut there is another reality. When we sleep we enter another reality where\nspirits move. This reality is driven by emotion and instinct.\u00a0 It is impossible\nto look at straight on.\u00a0 But it is always in our peripheral vision.\u00a0 It is the\ndomain of ecstasy and terror.\u00a0 It is the reason to live,\u00a0 yet this world\nthreatens our sanity if unaware or obsessed with it.",
