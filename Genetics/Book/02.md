# Chapter 2. DNA, Nucleotides, and the Language of Life

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of DNA, the molecule that serves as the
blueprint for all living organisms. We will examine the atomic structure of DNA, explore
nucleotides as the building blocks of the genetic code, discuss the universality of the genetic
code, and explain the central dogma of molecular biology.


## The Atomic Structure of DNA

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a complex molecule composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone and four
nucleotide bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The backbone is made up
of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules and serves as a universal connector. One of the most
intriguing aspects of DNA is that there is no inherent chemical drive for the specific sequence of
nucleotides, allowing for an almost infinite variety of genetic sequences to be formed.

In addition to the backbone, the nucleotide bases play a crucial role in the structure and function
of DNA. The bases follow specific pairing rules, known as Watson-Crick base pairing, which dictate
that A always pairs with T, and G with C. This pairing serves as the "grammar" of the genetic code,
ensuring that the information stored in DNA can be accurately replicated and transmitted. Grammars
serve as important restrictions on what is and is not possible within a structured system. Whenever
designing new pieces it's important to know what is constrained and what is not constrained.
Consider some of our early misconceptions about DNA from history.


### Discovery of DNA

"Watson-Crick model of DNA structure," which was proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.
 This model was based on X-ray crystallography data obtained by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice
 Wilkins, which showed that DNA had a helical structure composed of two strands that were
 complementary to each other.

One of the key insights of the Watson-Crick model was the discovery of the specific base-pairing
rules that allow for the two complementary strands of DNA to zip together. Specifically, they
proposed that adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with
cytosine (C). This base pairing allowed for the sequence of one DNA strand to be determined by the
sequence of the other strand.


### Sequence Hypothesis

The discovery of the Watson-Crick model was a major breakthrough in the field of molecular biology,
and it paved the way for a deeper understanding of how genetic information is stored and
transmitted.

This discovery was followed by the "sequence hypothesis," which was proposed by Francis Crick in
1957. At the time, scientists had already discovered that DNA was made up of four nucleotides(A, T,
G, and C), and they knew that these nucleotides could be arranged in different orders to form the
genetic code. However, they did not yet understand how these nucleotides were arranged within the
DNA molecule itself.

Crick's sequence hypothesis proposed that the nucleotides in a single strand of DNA were not
chemically linked to each other, and that there was no predetermined order or sequence that they
had to follow. Instead, he suggested that the nucleotides were held together by weak chemical bonds
and that they could arrange themselves in any order.

This hypothesis was a major departure from the prevailing view at the time, which held that the
sequence of nucleotides in DNA was somehow determined by the chemical properties of the nucleotides
themselves. Crick's sequence hypothesis opened up new avenues of research into the mechanisms of
DNA replication and transcription, and it helped to establish the field of molecular biology as we
know it today. The fact that the backbone does not constrain the progression of nucleotide
sequences makes DNA capable of acting as a universal storage medium. It also makes error correction
via the double strand Watson-Crick pairing necessary, since any combination could be valid.


## Nucleotides as the Building Blocks of DNA

The versatility of DNA's structure allows for any order of nucleotide bases, meaning that virtually
anything can be "spelled" within the genetic code. This flexibility is evidenced by the existence
of special sequences that have unique functions or consequences within the DNA.

One example of a special sequence is a long stretch of a single base, such as AAAAA. These
repetitive sequences can be involved in the regulation of gene expression or the formation of
certain DNA structures, which allow the DNA to open more easily. However, repetitive sequences can
also lead to genomic instability, as they are more prone to mutations and can result in the
formation of abnormal DNA structures, potentially leading to genetic disorders. T-T is more
sensitive to UV radiation and skin cancer.

CpG islands are another example of special sequences. These regions are characterized by a high
frequency of cytosine (C) and guanine (G) bases, specifically where cytosine is followed by
guanine (CpG). CpG islands are often found near the promoter regions of genes, and their
methylation status plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. When the cytosine bases in
CpG islands are methylated, gene expression is typically repressed, while unmethylated CpG islands
are associated with active gene transcription.


## The Genetic Code and Its Universality

One of the most striking features of DNA is the universality of the genetic code or codon code,
which is shared by almost all living organisms. The genetic code is comprised of triplets of
nucleotides called codons, each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid. There are 64
possible codons, and most organisms use the same codon-to-amino acid assignments, highlighting the
shared evolutionary history of life on Earth.

The genetic code also exhibits redundancy, meaning that multiple codons can code for the same amino
acid. This redundancy serves several purposes, such as providing error protection (mutations in one
codon may still result in the same amino acid) and allowing for fine-tuning of protein synthesis
rates (some codons are translated more quickly or accurately than others).


## The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

The central dogma of molecular biology is a fundamental concept that describes the flow of genetic
information within a biological system. It states that information in DNA is transcribed into RNA,
which is then translated into proteins. This process can be likened to a factory, where the DNA
serves as the blueprint for the construction of proteins, which are assembled by the cell's
molecular machinery.

In more detail, the central dogma involves three main steps:

1. **Transcription**: The DNA's genetic information is copied into a complementary RNA molecule
called messenger RNA (mRNA) by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. 

2. **Translation**: The mRNA is read by ribosomes, cellular structures that synthesize proteins. The
ribosomes "translate" the genetic information in the mRNA into a specific sequence of amino acids,
which are the building blocks of proteins. 

3. **Protein Folding and Function**: Once the amino acid sequence has been assembled, the protein
folds into its unique three-dimensional structure, which determines its function within the cell.
Some proteins require additional processing or modifications before they become fully functional.

The central dogma of molecular biology underscores the importance of DNA, RNA, and proteins in the
operation of living organisms. By understanding the intricate relationships between these molecules
and the processes that govern their interactions, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the
complexity and beauty of life.

Through the exploration of DNA, nucleotides, and the genetic code, we have seen how life has evolved
a versatile and highly adaptable system for storing and transmitting the information needed to
build and maintain living organisms. The atomic structure of DNA, with its sugar-phosphate backbone
and complementary base pairing, provides the foundation for the vast array of genetic sequences
that give rise to the incredible diversity of life on Earth. The universality of the genetic code
and the central dogma of molecular biology highlight the deep connections shared by all living
organisms.

Using the codon code, ~20,000 human genes produce over 100,000 proteins [1]

proteins function and interact.
