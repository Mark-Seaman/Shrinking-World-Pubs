# Chapter 3. Building Genes to Make Proteins

In this chapter, we will explore the intricacies of gene structure and function, as well as the processes that occur to transform genetic information into functional proteins. We will discuss the building blocks and the abstraction principles that govern the assembly and function of genes, transcription, RNA processing, and translation.

## 3.1 The Structure and Organization of Genes

Genes, the fundamental units of heredity, are segments of DNA that encode the information required to produce proteins. The organization and structure of genes play a critical role in determining their function and regulation. In this section, we will discuss the linear organization of genes on chromosomes, the coding and non-coding regions of genes, and the regulatory elements involved in gene expression.

### 3.1.1 The linear organization of genes on chromosomes

Genes are arranged linearly along chromosomes, the DNA-protein complexes found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Each chromosome contains multiple genes, with specific locations called loci. The arrangement of genes on chromosomes is not random, and certain genes may be clustered together based on their function or regulation. For example, the Hox genes, responsible for body patterning during development, are organized in a linear sequence on the chromosome that corresponds to the order of their expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing embryo.

### 3.1.2 Introns and exons: the coding and non-coding regions of genes

Eukaryotic genes are composed of coding and non-coding regions. The coding regions, called exons, contain the information required to produce proteins, while the non-coding regions, called introns, do not. Introns and exons are interspersed within a gene, and their presence and arrangement can have functional implications. For instance, the gene encoding the protein dystrophin, responsible for connecting muscle cells to their surrounding matrix, has 79 exons spanning over 2.4 million base pairs of DNA. Mutations in this gene can lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a severe form of muscular degeneration.

### 3.1.3 Regulatory elements: promoters, enhancers, and silencers

Genes also contain regulatory elements that control their expression. Promoters are sequences located near the transcription start site, where the transcription machinery assembles to initiate transcription. Enhancers are sequences that can be located far away from the gene they regulate, and they function to increase the rate of transcription. Silencers, on the other hand, are sequences that decrease the rate of transcription. The interaction between these regulatory elements and specific proteins called transcription factors ensures the appropriate expression of genes in response to cellular signals and environmental conditions.

### 3.1.4 Alternative splicing: generating protein diversity from a single gene

Alternative splicing is a process by which different combinations of exons within a gene are joined together to produce multiple mRNA molecules, each encoding a distinct protein isoform. This process increases the protein-coding capacity of the genome without increasing the number of genes. A well-known example of alternative splicing is the human gene encoding the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in pain signaling and blood vessel dilation. Depending on the exons included in the mRNA molecule, the gene can produce either calcitonin, a hormone involved in calcium regulation, or CGRP, a neuropeptide.

## 3.2 Transcription: From DNA to RNA

Transcription is the process by which the genetic information encoded in DNA is copied into RNA. This section will cover the role of RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcription, as well as the initiation, elongation, and termination phases of the process. We will also discuss the building blocks of RNA and the function of transcription factors in gene regulation.

### 3.2.1 The role of RNA polymerase in transcription

RNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA molecules from a DNA template. In eukaryotes, there are three types of RNA polymerase: RNA polymerase I, II, and III. Each type is responsible for transcribing different classes of RNA molecules, with RNA polymerase II being the primary enzyme involved in synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA), the RNA molecule that carries the genetic information required for protein synthesis.

### 3.2.2 Initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription

Transcription can be divided into three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, the transcription machinery, which includes RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and other regulatory proteins, assembles at the promoter region of the gene. This process involves the unwinding of the DNA double helix, allowing RNA polymerase to access the DNA template strand.

Elongation involves the addition of ribonucleotides to the growing RNA chain, following the rules of Watson-Crick base pairing. As RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template, the newly synthesized RNA molecule is released from the enzyme, allowing the DNA double helix to re-form behind it.

Termination occurs when RNA polymerase encounters a specific sequence in the DNA template called a terminator. This signal prompts the release of the completed RNA molecule and the disassembly of the transcription machinery.

### 3.2.3 The building blocks of RNA: ribonucleotides

The building blocks of RNA are ribonucleotides, which consist of a ribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or uracil (U). RNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning that new ribonucleotides are added to the 3' end of the growing chain. The sequence of ribonucleotides in an RNA molecule is determined by the sequence of deoxyribonucleotides in the DNA template strand, following the rules of base pairing.

### 3.2.4 Transcription factors and their role in gene regulation

Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences, often within the promoter or enhancer regions of genes, and regulate the rate of transcription. Some transcription factors function as activators, promoting the assembly of the transcription machinery and increasing the rate of transcription, while others function as repressors, inhibiting the assembly of the transcription machinery and decreasing the rate of transcription. The coordinated action of multiple transcription factors allows for the precise regulation of gene expression in response to cellular signals and environmental conditions.

## 3.3 RNA Processing

Once transcription is complete, the newly synthesized RNA molecule undergoes a series of modifications before it can be used as a template for protein synthesis. This section will cover the addition of the 5' cap and the 3' poly-A tail, the splicing process, and the molecular machinery involved in splicing.

### 3.3.1 The addition of the 5' cap and the 3' poly-A tail

The 5' cap is a modified guanosine nucleotide that is added to the 5' end of the nascent RNA molecule. This cap plays a critical role in protecting the RNA molecule from degradation and is essential for its recognition by the ribosome during translation. The 3' poly-A tail is a long stretch of adenine nucleotides added to the 3' end of the RNA molecule. The poly-A tail stabilizes the RNA molecule and assists in its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs.

### 3.3.2 Splicing: the removal of introns and joining of exons

Before an mRNA molecule can be used as a template for protein synthesis, the non-coding introns must be removed, and the coding exons must be joined together. This process, called splicing, is carried out by a complex molecular machinery called the spliceosome, which recognizes specific sequences at the intron-exon boundaries and catalyzes the removal of introns and the ligation of exons.

### 3.3.3 Spliceosome: the molecular machinery of splicing

The spliceosome is a large, dynamic complex composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and numerous other protein factors. The snRNPs are RNA-protein complexes that recognize the intron-exon boundaries and participate in the catalysis of the splicing reaction. The spliceosome assembles on the pre-mRNA molecule, undergoes a series of conformational changes, and ultimately releases the spliced mRNA and the excised introns.

### 3.3.4 Alternative splicing and its role in protein diversity

As mentioned earlier, alternative splicing is a process that generates multiple mRNA molecules from a single gene, each encoding a distinct protein isoform. This process is an important mechanism for increasing protein diversity and complexity in eukaryotic organisms. In humans, it is estimated that up to 95% of multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing, highlighting its significance in the regulation of gene expression and the generation of cellular complexity.

## 3.4 Translation: From RNA to Protein

Translation is the process by which the genetic information encoded in mRNA is used to synthesize proteins. In this section, we will discuss the role of ribosomes in translation, the building blocks of proteins, the genetic code, and the initiation, elongation, and termination phases of translation.

### 3.4.1 The role of ribosomes in translation

Ribosomes are large, complex molecular machines composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins. They are responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of proteins by decoding the mRNA sequence and facilitating the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids. In eukaryotic cells, ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm and can be either free-floating or associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, a cellular organelle involved in protein synthesis and processing.

### 3.4.2 The building blocks of proteins: amino acids

Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids, each with unique chemical properties that determine the structure and function of the protein they compose. Amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, which are formed between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another.

### 3.4.3 The genetic code: codons and the translation of mRNA

The genetic code is the set of rules that governs the translation of the mRNA sequence into a protein sequence. The genetic code is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons, each of which corresponds to a specific amino acid. The genetic code is redundant, meaning that multiple codons can encode the same amino acid. For example, the amino acid leucine can be encoded by six different codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. This redundancy provides a certain level of robustness against mutations that might otherwise disrupt protein function.

### 3.4.4 Initiation, elongation, and termination of translation

Translation is a highly regulated process that can be divided into three main stages : initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, the ribosome, composed of two subunits, assembles on the mRNA molecule at the start codon (usually AUG), which encodes the amino acid methionine. This step requires the participation of several initiation factors and a specialized transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule called the initiator tRNA, which carries methionine.

Elongation involves the sequential addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Each amino acid is carried by a tRNA molecule, which recognizes the appropriate codon on the mRNA through a process called base pairing. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it facilitates the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids, creating the protein chain. Elongation factors assist in this process, ensuring the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis.

Termination occurs when the ribosome encounters one of three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA), which do not encode an amino acid. Instead, they signal the release of the completed polypeptide chain and the disassembly of the ribosome from the mRNA molecule. Termination factors recognize the stop codons and facilitate the release of the newly synthesized protein.

In summary, this chapter has provided an in-depth look at the intricacies of gene structure and function, as well as the processes involved in transforming genetic information into functional proteins. We have explored the organization of genes on chromosomes, the coding and non-coding regions of genes, the regulatory elements involved in gene expression, and the molecular machinery involved in transcription, RNA processing, and translation. Understanding these fundamental aspects of molecular biology is crucial for comprehending the complexities of life at the molecular level and for developing new therapies and technologies that harness the power of the genetic code.
