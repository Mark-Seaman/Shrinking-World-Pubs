We're going to start writing Chapter 1. 

Expand this text into evocative, interesting, educational, and engaging prose about the intersection of biology and engineering principles. 

Outline:
### 1. Building with Carbon. Why Carbon? Nutrients and Vitamins
   - Guide to this book
   - The power of building blocks and abstraction in engineering
   - The significance of carbon in life
   - The chemistry of carbon
   - Nutrients and their roles in cellular processes

Main points:
* This book will step you through the levels of hierarchy of biology from atoms to an entire human body. 
* We'll be using the framework of building blocks to understand how each level is put together and how they interact.
* A building blocks are like legos. They click together because they share a common interface. They create new capabilities. 
* Abstraction: building a larger more complex building block from simpler building blocks can allow you to make really impressive capabilities. This trick allows life to come from non-living things and for computers to "think" when they're made from organized sand. Many simple components working together in an organized way to make something more complex.
* Carbon: our first build block starts at the atomic level with carbon. It has the capability to bond with 4 other atoms. [list ways this is crucial] it can form double bonds. It's also semi-stable at room temperature, unlike metals which would require too much heat to be alive.
* Conclusion: Carbon is basis for all life and the first step on our ladder of abstraction. We'll continue building more building blocks with increasingly complex capabilities.

# 1. Building with Carbon. Why Carbon? Nutrients and Vitamins
Welcome to a thrilling journey through the world of cell biology! This book will guide you through the complex layers of biology, starting from the atomic level all the way up to the fascinating, interconnected systems that make up the human body. Our goal is to help you understand the intricate workings of life by using a framework of building blocks—similar to Legos—and abstraction principles.

Much like the way individual Lego pieces click together through a shared interface, biological building blocks can be combined to create an array of new capabilities. By using abstraction, we can construct larger and more complex structures from simpler components. This powerful concept is what allows life to emerge from non-living things and computers to "think" despite being made from organized sand. In essence, it's the magic that occurs when many simple components work together in an organized fashion to create something more complex.

At the foundation of our journey lies carbon, the first building block that forms the basis for all life on Earth. Carbon is unique in its ability to bond with four other atoms, giving it unparalleled versatility in forming complex molecules. This capability enables carbon to create stable structures like chains, rings, and branches, providing a variety of options for assembling the building blocks of life. Furthermore, carbon's ability to form double bonds adds to its stability and versatility. An added bonus is that carbon remains semi-stable at room temperature, unlike metals, which would require too much heat to support life as we know it.

So why is carbon so crucial to life? Its unique bonding capabilities allow it to form the backbone of countless organic molecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. These molecules are essential for the structure and function of all living organisms. In addition, carbon serves as a critical component of various nutrients and vitamins, which play vital roles in the cellular processes that keep life humming along.

In conclusion, carbon is the foundational building block of life and the first step in our ladder of abstraction. As we continue our journey through this book, we'll explore even more building blocks, each with increasingly complex capabilities, ultimately unveiling the awe-inspiring intricacies of life itself. Get ready to embark on a captivating adventure that bridges the worlds of biology and engineering, unlocking the secrets of life from the ground up.
