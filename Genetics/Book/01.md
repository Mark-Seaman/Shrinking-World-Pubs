## Week 1 Lesson Plan

Lesson Plan: Introduction to Genetics

### Objectives:
- Understand the basic principles of genetics, including DNA structure and replication, gene
  expression, and regulation.
- Learn about the history of genetics and its significance in modern biology.
- Develop an understanding of the scientific method and how it applies to genetics research.

### Materials:
- Textbook: "Genetics: From Genes to Genomes" by Leland Hartwell, et al.
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on DNA structure and function
- Videos on the history of genetics

### Activities:
- Introduction (10 minutes)
    - Welcome students to the class and introduce the topic of genetics.
    - Ask students what they already know about genetics and what they hope to learn in this
      course.
- History of Genetics (30 minutes)
    - Show videos on the history of genetics and its significance in modern biology.
    - Discuss key historical figures in genetics, such as Gregor Mendel, James Watson, and Francis
      Crick.
    - Ask students to identify important discoveries in genetics and how they have impacted modern
      science.
- DNA Structure and Function (60 minutes)
    - Introduce the structure and function of DNA, including base pairing and DNA replication.
    - Use the whiteboard to draw and label the structure of DNA.
    - Distribute handouts on DNA structure and function and ask students to read and summarize key
      points.
- Gene Expression and Regulation (30 minutes)
    - Explain how genes are expressed and regulated, including the roles of transcription and
      translation.
    - Use examples to illustrate how gene expression can be influenced by environmental factors.
    - Ask students to brainstorm possible factors that could influence gene expression.
- Scientific Method (20 minutes)
    - Introduce the scientific method and how it applies to genetics research.
    - Discuss the importance of hypothesis testing, data analysis, and peer review in scientific
      research.
    - Ask students to develop a hypothesis related to genetics and design an experiment to test it.

### Assessment:
- Collect completed handouts on DNA structure and function.
- Assign a homework assignment to write a paragraph summarizing the history of genetics.

### Homework:
- Write a paragraph summarizing the history of genetics, including key historical figures and
  discoveries.
