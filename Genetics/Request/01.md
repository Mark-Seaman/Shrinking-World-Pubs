# 1. Building with Carbon. Why Carbon? Nutrients and Vitamins

## Request


We're going to start writing Chapter 1. 

Expand this text into evocative, interesting, educational, and engaging prose about the intersection of biology and engineering principles. 

Outline:
### 1. Building with Carbon. Why Carbon? Nutrients and Vitamins
   - Guide to this book
   - The power of building blocks and abstraction in engineering
   - The significance of carbon in life
   - The chemistry of carbon
   - Nutrients and their roles in cellular processes

Main points:
* This book will step you through the levels of hierarchy of biology from atoms to an entire human body. 
* We'll be using the framework of building blocks to understand how each level is put together and how they interact.
* A building blocks are like legos. They click together because they share a common interface. They create new capabilities. 
* Abstraction: building a larger more complex building block from simpler building blocks can allow you to make really impressive capabilities. This trick allows life to come from non-living things and for computers to "think" when they're made from organized sand. Many simple components working together in an organized way to make something more complex.
* Carbon: our first build block starts at the atomic level with carbon. It has the capability to bond with 4 other atoms. [list ways this is crucial] it can form double bonds. It's also semi-stable at room temperature, unlike metals which would require too much heat to be alive.
* Conclusion: Carbon is basis for all life and the first step on our ladder of abstraction. We'll continue building more building blocks with increasingly complex capabilities.
