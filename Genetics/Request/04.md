### 4. Proteins, Folding, and Protein Complexes
   - Proteins: molecular machinery of life
     * [get students hyped to learn about proteins]
     * [how many proteins are there anyways?]
   - Amino acids as the building blocks of proteins
     * [call back to abstraction principles]
     * any order means most amino acid sequences have no function
   - Protein folding and its importance
     * AA order determines fold
     * fold determines function
   - Protein-protein interactions and complexes
     * P-P interaction are the next level of vocab synthesis
     * One protein, many complexes
     * Complexes gain and lose parts as regulation
