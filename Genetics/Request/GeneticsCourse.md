## Course: Genetics 101

### Course Overview: 

This course will provide high school students with an introduction to the
fascinating world of genetics. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on activities, and
discussions, students will learn about the principles of genetics, the structure and function
of DNA, and the ways in which genetic traits are inherited.

### Course Objectives:

1. To understand the basic principles of genetics, including DNA structure and replication, gene
expression, and inheritance patterns. 

2. To explore the ethical and social implications of genetic
research and genetic engineering. 

3. To develop skills in scientific inquiry, data analysis, and
critical thinking. Course Outline:
