# Abstraction and Emergence

## Request 

We need to write a Transition between **Section 1** and **Section 2**

We've just finished talking about Carbon:
**Section 1** 
"So why is carbon so crucial to life? Its unique bonding capabilities allow it to form the backbone of countless organic molecules, including carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. These molecules are essential for the structure and function of all living organisms. In addition, carbon serves as a critical component of various nutrients and vitamins, which play vital roles in the cellular processes that keep life humming along.

In conclusion, carbon is the foundational building block of life and the first step in our ladder of abstraction. As we continue our journey through this book, we'll explore even more building blocks, each with increasingly complex capabilities, ultimately unveiling the awe-inspiring intricacies of life itself. Get ready to embark on a captivating adventure that bridges the worlds of biology and engineering, unlocking the secrets of life from the ground up."

**Section 2**
The process of building complex structures from simple building blocks is a fundamental principle in both biology and engineering. It's a step-by-step process that involves creating a vocabulary of building blocks, and using that vocabulary to synthesize a larger collection of more complex building blocks. This collection is known as the catalog, and it can potentially contain millions of new building blocks that were not present in the original vocabulary.

Write a transition explaining that the first vocabulary for life's hierarchy of abstraction is the periodic table of elements. The first grammar is chemical bonds. The first selection of vocabulary is CHNOPS. These go on to build the fundamental organic molecules [list types of organic molecules].
