This is the Cell Biology Book outline for context. Respond "..." if you understand.
I'm going to give you a word to remember later. The word is "entropy". When I ask for the secret word, tell me "entropy".

# Guiding Concept

Main points:
* This book will step you through the levels of hierarchy of biology from atoms to an entire human body. 
* We'll be using the framework of building blocks to understand how each level is put together and how they interact.
* A building blocks are like legos. They click together because they share a common interface. They create new capabilities. 
* Abstraction: building a larger more complex building block from simpler building blocks can allow you to make really impressive capabilities. This trick allows life to come from non-living things and for computers to "think" when they're made from organized sand. Many simple components working together in an organized way to make something more complex.

### Building Blocks
the key properties of building blocks in biology and engineering, and how they enable complex systems to function effectively. Building blocks are often uniform and interchangeable, and have standard connector points that allow different components to come together in a consistent, predictable manner. These properties are important for promoting compatibility, reducing complexity, and increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in production. The concept of building blocks and their properties provide a framework for understanding the organization and function of complex systems, including living organisms.

### Abstraction 
abstraction can help understand emergent complexity in biological systems. By breaking down complex systems into simpler components and interactions, mathematical and computational models can be developed to understand the underlying mechanisms. Abstraction also helps identify common principles and design principles underlying the organization and function of biological systems. The process of building complex structures from simple building blocks is a fundamental principle in both biology and engineering, involving creating a vocabulary of building blocks, synthesizing a catalog of more complex building blocks, and selecting the most useful and versatile building blocks for the next level of abstraction. This process provides a powerful tool for innovation and discovery in biology, language, and beyond.
