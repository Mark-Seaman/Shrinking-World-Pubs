7. Organelles, Specialized Functions, and the Origins of Organs
  - Intro: Division of labor
    * What are cellular organelles
    * [more]
  - Differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells
    * Diffusion and reaction times with exponential drop off by size
    * Membranes fix reaction times
    * Phase condensates and Chromatin regions do the same trick at nano scales
    * Eukaryotes segregate [examples]
  - Membrane-bound organelles and their specialized functions
    * Mitochondria
    * Golgdi, ER, Vacuoles, Etc.
  - The development of organs as groups of specialized cells
    * Stem cell differentiation
    * All cells have the same genome, your toes can think, your ears can see, your eyes digest. None of them do it very well due to specialization
    * Organs allow economy of scale. [Examples from ecology, seaweed, bacterial macro communities]
    * The capabilities of the macro scale all comes from the micro scale
