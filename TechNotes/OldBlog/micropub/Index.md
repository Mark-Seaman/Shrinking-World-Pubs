# Micropublishing

Traditional publishing has been in place for over fifty years.  But all of the segments of the
industry (books, magazines, and newspapers) are in sharp decline.  They have not been able to 
adapt to the world that is defined by the internet.

The demise of traditional publishing creates a huge challenge and opportunity for authors.  How
do we make our voices heard in this new world?

The answer is found in an emerging model, called micropublishing.  To thrive in the internet world
requires the following characteristics.

* Multiple sizes of the publishing payload
* Interconnected information with hyperlinks
* Multimedia with written and video formats
* Easy feedback for author
* Community collaboration
* Effortless distribution of content

Micropublishing addresses all of these issues with a set of tools and techniques that utilize 
web technology to deliver content to consumers.
