# Riding the Mastodon

## What is Mastodon?

Social Networking can be a great benefit to society, but its misuse can also pose a major threat.
Ever since I watched the Social Dilemma on Netflix, I have been deeply concerned about the impact
that social media has on our mental health and our society. Flaws are based on the business model
that drives American companies.  They are compelled to make decisions to increase profits despite
any social implications.

Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are all driven by advertising and an algorithm is responsible for
selecting content to show users that increases ad revenue.  The selections are made by code that
optimizes the probability that the user will follow the link.  This favors the more sensational
content, and minimizes the lesser.

This tends to push people toward more extreme content over time.  People who spend significant
time on Facebook and Twitter result in a measurable decrease in mental health and well-being.  This is 
directly tied to how these services are constructed.  We see the negative effects of
this daily and yet most of us are powerless to do anything about it.

Open-source social media provides an alternative to this path of madness.  There are alternative
services to Twitter and Facebook that provide the same value to the users, but are not driven
by commercial interests.   In these services, the content is not selected for you by the software.
Instead you choose who to follow and see all of the content that is posted.

These services are run for the public good and have no aspirations of making money.  Because of that,
they do not need to control the behavior of the users.  This is the original aspiration of the
internet, which has now been largely lost by the rise of advertising.

If social media is causing you stress, then leave that world before it causes permanent damage. 
Move to Mastodon from Twitter to lower stress due to doom scrolling and rage surfing.  Twitter
decides what you see and pushes you to the extreme.  Mastodon lets you see all the messages from 
those you follow so you see what you want.

I have been astounded by the difference between the two services that provide such similar
functionality.  I never want to go back and regret waiting so long to make the jump.  Elon Musk's 
meltdown of Twitter finally gave me the boost I needed to make this jump.


### Ten Minutes to Toot

- Step 1 - Decide on a server.   I chose to register at "mas.to".   
- Step 2 - I set up an account "@mdseaman@mas.to".  It then requires that you verify the email address.
- Step 3 - Use the search box to find someone interesting. (try #ringsofpower, #xkcd, #mastodon)
- Step 4 - Follow someone
- Step 5 - Setup your profile
- Step 6 - Make a toot


## Basic Concepts


### Toot

Messages are called Tweets on Twitter and Toots on Mastodon.   This silly name reminds us to not take ourselves so seriously, even as we are trying the save the world.

### Boost

Similar to retweeting on Twitter.  Your followers are sent the message when you boost it.   No modification is allowed to prevent escalation and "dunking".

### Favorites and Bookmarks

Favorites are similar to Twitter likes.  The poster gets a notification that you appreciate their post. But the message is not sent to your followers.   Bookmarks let you remember posts but do not notify anyone.

### Posting Scope

You can control who gets notified of a post. This lets you control how you communicate
with others.  Nothing happens behind your back.

- Public - Both mentioned people and followers
- Follower Only - Only followers
- Mentioned People Only - Only mentioned people
- Unlisted - Neither mentioned people or followers

### Content Warning

Each service provider has its own rules for how to interact with others.
Content Warnings mark posts that some people might find disturbing.  Do not inflict 
your angst on others.  are Emotional kindness - don't trigger others
Use CW liberally as a demonstration of respect and kindness to others.
Communicate within the normal modes of social etiquette that you see.

### Selecting a Server

Mastodon is the software that allows the exchange between services.  This software
is hosted on separate servers and communities gather on the server.  You can exchange
messages with anyone anywhere. This is similar to how email works and the opposite of 
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.

By escaping from the domination of large company interests the nature of the 
communication and the degree of control in the local community is astounding.  The need to make
money forces a huge amount of dysfunction in the big tech services.

All of these services are federated so that you can send and receive content from other servers.
But the local communities can also filter abusers to protect the local users.  Make sure that
what you are wanting to do fits well with the terms of service and code of conduct of your host
instance.
