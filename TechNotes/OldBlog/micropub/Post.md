## One Page of Text

The basic unit of publishing in the Micropub world is a single page of text.  This consists of about
250 words composed of 4 or 5 paragraphs.  Each paragraph is created to express a single idea.
This means that a Post consists of multiple Messages, which can be extracted from the text.

This is about the right size for a blog post that can be easily consumed in five minutes. A single
page of text can describe several details to convey one basic topic.  This Post is the building
block for a larger Article that discusses multiple related topics.

The Micropub concept calls for six nested levels of structure composing the body of knowledge. The 
small levels offer access to a large audience by limiting the required attention for consumers.

* Message - 50 words - 1 minute
* Post - 250 words - 5 minutes
* Article - 1000 words - 20 minutes


## Video or Live Presentation

The post may be delivered by written text or by spoken presentation.  This amount of content takes
about 5 minutes and is suitable for video recordings of that length.  Some consumers prefer text while
others would choose the video.  Why not give your consumers the choice by supporting both?


## Links

No information lives within a vacuum.  The Micropub paradigm calls for all of the information to
be composed in a hierarchy.  There is a natural way to navigate this data tree, called the 
reading order.

Imagine a book composed of parts, chapters, subheadings, topics, and paragraphs.  Instead of moving
through the hierarchy, the reader is given a sequential list of pages that are a natural progression
through the content.

Depending on the rigor of the content structure, the posts that are closest in the reading order 
will be the most related to the current post being read.  This makes for a highly natural way 
to present the related topics for further reading.

The Pub Reader software shows the two previous blog posts and the two next blog posts as links. By
clicking on the Post titles the user can immediately visit other related topics.

A blog post should teach one specific topic and give immediate access for further
investigation.  I find that four related topics give the readers some options to satisfy their
curiosity.


## The Perfect Blog Post

Personal guidelines for writing a blog post

- **Length** - The post is between 250 - 300 words long.
- **Topic** - A single topic is discussed with four subtopics.  This provides internal structure within the post.
- **Messages** -  Contains Messages that can be extracted for posting on Social Networks.  Each paragraph can yield a Message.
- **Connecting Links** - The post lives within an information web connected by hyperlinks.  Both the reading order and hierarchy are clearly visible and allow readers to navigate to related topics.
- **Self-contained** - The concepts are understandable and don't require reading any other posts.
- **Title** - Every post has a strong headline to draw the reader in.


## Writing Posts

Writing a great post worth reading will take one or two hours.  Be sure to give the post time to
age and mature. Write the draft in a hurry but let it rest for a while before posting it online.
Work on the tone, grammar, spelling, and word choice to make sure that it connects with your 
audience.  Take the time to ponder.

If you are expecting readers to consume the content as you release it then delivering one page 
each day is the limit.  One blog post or 5-minute video released weekly is a good rhythm to use.
This balances the desire to publish regularly with the attention span of your audience.  It also
limits the amount of effort required to produce the content.

The starting point for any writer should be to write a weekly blog with one page posts.  This can
be organized in a way that can produce longer content by serializing the work.
