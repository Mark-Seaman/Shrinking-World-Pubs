## Understanding Technical Debt

Technical debt is a lot like like financial debt. Tech giants Bill Hewlett and
David Packard decided on a very controversial path by rejecting using debt to
grow their business. This counter-cultural stance contributed significantly to
the financial stability and early success of Hewlett-Packard. As architects, we
must also make a similar stand to protect our systems from the Siren's call of
easy results at the expense of technical debt and the resulting rapid decay.

Before we can figure out how to decrease the technical debt on a project we have
to find it. Martin Fowler's classic book, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of
Existing Code", provides us with excellent advice on how to keep our code clean.

His analogy is when cleaning house we use our nose to detect bad smells that
need to be addressed. We can learn to detect bad things within our code by
learning to identify the bad smells. This is certainly true of old code but it
can also be generalized to the broader scope of project debt. Some projects may
have very little code debt and massive planning debt. Learning to recognize the
full range of bad smells that emanate from a project is a valuable skill.


### Problem Solving Dynamics

Debt starts with a problem. If we assume that engineers can often solve a single
problem in an hour, then an engineer can solve roughly 2,000 problems every
year. But what if the project calls for you to solve 4,000 problems every year?

Problems happen in every domain and they all compete for a limited bank of mindshare:

* Definition of the product
* Implementation of new features
* Writing tests
* Supervising the test execution
* Sending out early marketing units
* Attending mandatory corporate training sessions
* Writing TPS reports
* Reporting scrum status
* Preparing for the visit of the VP
* Addressing customer issues for the existing product
* Investigating a new tool for continuous delivery
* Making sure that everyone is able to use the new Integrated Development Environment

The list is infinite but each engineer only has one brain. Which 2,000 problems
will you solve over the next year? You will choose wisely by selecting the
problems that bring you the biggest return on investment. Do the easy stuff -
but continue to do some of the hard things as well. You can't possibly do
everything so always look for the highest ROI.

It is Monday morning and you have just updated your action list. You have 30
items that you really need to get done today. Is this realistic? You can tell
yourself that you will really try hard today and get it all done but you know it
is impossible.

Make sure that the eight to ten things that you actually address are the most
critical. Everything else will have to wait or go to someone else. Remember,
when something should really get done and doesn't make the cut, you are creating
a project IOU for the item and your debt just increased. This might be a defect
in the code or a design alternative to investigate or a communication to be sent
to upper management. There are many actions that must be taken and every
deferred action becomes a debt to the project.

Someday you must give an account. Try to defer the tasks that don't produce a
critical value for the project. Neglect some of the busywork that is promoted
within every organization in favor of tasks that get you closer to business
success.


### Work Left Undone

I once worked on a project where a massive amount of code had been written by a
brilliant individual in a top-of-mind orgy of complexity. There was a single
function that was 3000 lines long. I printed it out so that I could review and
understand the structure. The nesting of the indent levels was so great that the
code would wrap horizontally off the end of the line. It required multiple
lines of output to show one line of text. That day I learned what massive
technical debt looks like.

The tragedy of this situation was that the functionality of the code was indeed
brilliant - the business value of the system was very high. But the coding debt
was large enough to bring the net value of the system into question.

What is the debt? If debt occurs when you write the IOU, then its value can be
quantified. What will it take (in hours) to fix the problem? This will let you
easily measure any type of debt in your system.

In the project I just referenced, I spent about 40 hours refactoring the massive
knot in the code. The system represented about 2,000 hours of development. We
also had some other problems that would account for a total of 200 hours of
additional repair work. After 200 hours of investment we were able to capture
2,000 hours of benefit. Without that payoff the system would have been doomed to
early replacement. This looks like an ROI of ten times for the debt payoff
effort and is fairly typical of projects.

    Net Worth = Business Value - Effort to eliminate debt

Another scenario that is very common is a system that has accumulated a debt so
massive that it far exceeds the value of the system itself. The benefit
(Business Value) of the system can be measured by looking at the replacement
cost.


### Estimating System Value

An enterprise level web application of reasonably small scope can be built in
about 1,000 hours of engineering by a competent team. Many systems exist that
required 10,000+ hours to build over several years. Although the cost to create
this system was actually 10,000 hours, the replacement cost may be much lower if
the system is rebuilt from scratch. In this case, we are replacing the code but
there is a large amount of leverage from the first version in the form of same
programming language, existing team, established development processes, and
knowledge of the business needs. Assuming a replacement cost of only 1,000
hours, the value of the system to the business is 1,000 hours of development
time.

Notice that the actual business value is far less than the actual cost of the
existing system. This is because the entire system can be replaced for a
fraction of the original cost. The existing system may require another 2,000
hours of work to get it in good shape so the technical debt can be calculated at
2,000 hours. The business would be better off replacing the system than fixing
the debt. A system must have a great deal of value _and_ low debt in order to
justify the cost of maintenance and extension.

Businesses will frequently over-value the system because of the high sunk cost
to get to the initial product. They will continue to invest in legacy software
that has exceeded its useful life for fear of not being able to successfully
create a replacement. We stick with the evil we know rather than starting with a
fresh approach. This is where leverage comes in - by utilizing all of the
understanding that has been gained with the first version we can build the new
system for a fraction of the original cost. We leverage our understanding into a
fresh implementation that doesn't have any technical debt.


## The Principle of Balanced Development

Software development requires that we balance our goals between different
dimensions. If all of our activity is concentrated in a single area, such as
coding or testing, then our project becomes lopsided. Our work must be
distributed properly to avoid technical debt.

The first dimensions that we must balance are investing in adding functionality
to the product _or_ investing in building quality. Neither of these are optional
- we can't have a product that is missing key features but is well polished and
refined. It is also isn't acceptable to add lots of features to a product with a
flawed foundation. A high quality product will have a balanced investment of 50%
for functionality and 50% for quality. Both features and the underlying
structure should get equal attention every day.

It isn't possible to do these in sequence, they must be done in parallel
throughout the development of the product. Improve the structure to make it
easier to add features, then fix the defects before optimizing the structure.
Repeating this cycle throughout the project leads to maximum leverage. If your
development practices follow this model you will never lose quality in pursuit
of new functionality _and_ you won't be stalled out by endless refinement.


### Below the Water Line 

Quality is often unseen but it is still critical to success. Some work will be
highly appreciated by your customers, clients, and bosses, but much of your work
can't be appreciated because it is hidden. Junior engineers often make the
mistake of working only on the visible parts because that is what gets rewarded
and praised. This is a serious mistake that puts the project in danger of
creating a bug farm. If we only do what our boss can appreciate we produce
something that no one will appreciate at all.

Managers are highly unlikely to ask engineers to refactor a piece of code so
that it's cleaner. Often it's a fight to be allowed to invest in refactoring. If
the software architect doesn't work on areas that are invisible and under-
appreciated we have to question whether they are functioning as an architect.
Certain things must be done simply because it is the right thing to do. If the
architect doesn't care whether the architecture serves the long-term business
interests of the company, who will? 50% of the day for an architect should be
spent thinking about the part of the system that no one sees because that hidden
foundation protects the part of the system that everyone else sees and values.

As Robert Martin at Object Mentor (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) taught us, even boy scouts
have a motto to leave the campsite in better condition than they found it.
Physicians take a vow to "Do no harm". Perhaps it's time for software developers
to commit to the same code of conduct?

Now let's combine these two areas of balance to discuss the daily tasks.


### Balanced Development

By arranging the tasks on the following axis we can define a set of activities
that must be balanced against each other. The typical day should start off with
testing. What changed while you weren't looking? Fix everything you find that
you don't like. Remember, fixing a bug now will keep it from breeding and save
you from fixing 100 bugs later.

![Development Task Types](img/Dev_Tasks.png)

Now figure out which new feature is the highest priority. Extend the code to
implement this feature. Set yourself a time limit and be satisfied with the
level of functionality that you're able to add during the limited time. This
will prevent building anything that you don't _really_ need.

Now focus on improving the structure. Find any hint of duplication in the area
that you were just working in. Try to reduce the number of lines of code in
half. Imagine that your biggest critic is about to examine the code - now clean
up anything that would be an embarrassment.

Repeat this cycle until you are done. This pattern will work well at several
different levels of granularity. Imagine a daily or weekly cycle. It also works
well at short intervals. I often work for closure every hour because this keeps
the amount of work in process to an absolute minimum and allows me to deploy new
features within an hour.

Experiment with this cyclical work. Find which types of work can be done
optimally with each rhythm and use what works for you. I find that no cycle is
too short. The important thing is to allow the full range of actions to be fully
balanced.

The other benefit is that a steady rhythm of predictable cycles will do wonders
for building trust. Over a few cycles people will begin to rely on the rate at
which your team can achieve high-quality delivery of functionality. This is the
best recipe for establishing or restoring trust within your organization.

If you let others set the complete agenda for your day you will spend all of
your time extending features and a little bit of time fixing defects. Ultimately,
the success of your projects will depend far more on what you do below the
water-line.


### Practical Reality

Let's be honest. We often don't have the luxury of solving all of the problems
that exist. Often we must concentrate on the critical issues and neglect
secondary issues. By definition, this creates debt and debt blocks leverage. But
you don't need to let the debt accumulate unchecked. Find ways to measure the
most critical forms of debt within your system. Use these numbers to create an
accounting. Track a score card by counting things like unimplemented features,
unresolved defects, excessive complexity, unwritten tests, and low test
coverage.

Make sure that these items get just as much mindshare as the new features that
were implemented in the last scrum cycle. Studies have shown that people spend
more when they pay with a credit card than with cash because it is so easy and
they don't "feel" the money being spent. A similar dynamic affects projects -
they will always choose debt unless you make it painfully clear that there is a
balance that will come due and must be paid.

We make trade-offs in every project - there is a time to ignore certain things
in favor of others. But we should do this consciously - by deliberate choice.
Don't just accept technical debt automatically without regard to its eventual
impact on the product - create a plan for when you are going to pay it off.


### Debt Can be Useful

Debt itself can be a form of leverage. You may choose to implement a bad
architecture that you know must be replaced eventually. Debt makes sense when it
leads you to a higher goal. For instance, neglect writing a group of tests to
get your coverage up. Or create a disposable prototype to investigate a
feasibility issue. But don't expect these things to be in the final product -
have a plan to pay off the shortcuts.

The acceptable level of risk changes throughout the project. At the beginning
of a project the risk is sky high. Very little is known and lots of unknown
challenges block the way to release. A well-run project lowers the risk
constantly throughout the development cycle. Key questions are answered by
validating the technology, proving market feasibility, and building
prototypes.

A poorly run project will leave many questions unanswered and allows the risk of
unknowns to remain high or even increase throughout the project. This type of
risk often causes projects to miss delivery dates and goals.

Mistakes made and problems deferred can create a risk that is different in
nature to the unknown risk. Unknown risk can diminish throughout the project
while the risk due to technical debt can build - think about this as the
knowable risk. Measure both types of technical debt and translate that knowledge
into plans to pay off the debt. You can know and reduce the amount of technical
debt that you carry - it should never be a surprise at the end of the project.

All types of technical debt represent a risk to your project. There is a low to
high probability that a bad thing might occur and the severity of the
consequence can range from serious to minor. The expected value of the risk is
the product of severity and likelihood. Try to pay off the risks with the
highest expected value first. Ultimately, you are playing a probability game -
the smaller your exposure, the better.

Wishful thinking is deadly. You can gamble with the project and assume that you
can consistently take on risks without being affected by it but someday the debt
for all of the trade-offs that have been made will come due. This may occur at a
time in the project when you can least afford it so be careful with how you
handle debt.


## Multiple Types of Debt

Debt comes in many forms and engineers experience each of these to varying
degrees on every project. Identifying the debt is an important first step in
managing it. Once you can see it you can begin to control it. It is often useful
to trade one type of debt for another to spread out the risk. Figure out where
your project is the most vulnerable and seek to mitigate that area of risk. For
example, if you determine that lack of testing poses the most serious threat
then refuse to increase your testing debt any further.

Each type of debt has an antidote - you can develop tools that will let you
objectively measure each type of debt within your project. This will require
some effort to set up but it'll have a huge impact on every aspect of the
project.


### Development Debt

The first major category of debt is about the process of developing software.
There are shortcuts that may be taken in every stage of the development life
cycle. What seems like a good idea now can result in far greater work later on.
Consider these examples:

* Switching technologies may require rewriting all the software.
* Poorly understood product requirements leads to an unusable product.
* Weak architecture and design causes software to decay very rapidly.
* Poor coding practices make evolutionary design impossible.
* Lack of automated testing causes defects to hide and blocks refactoring.

Individually these issues can cause problems for a project but when combined
together they can spell disaster. Review each phase of your life cycle and
identify the weak spots. Figure out how you intend to mitigate these
vulnerabilities.


### Operational Debt

The software is deployed after the development is complete. Customers begin
using the software for its intended purpose. A completely different set of
issues takes over. The focus shifts to how to support the needs of the live
customers and keep the system healthy. The following issues become the primary
focus of the team responsible for operations:

* Complex web service interactions make for difficult maintenance. 
* Long release schedules force increasing project scope and lower quality.
* Lack of deployment automation causes operational errors.
* Weak system monitoring requires staff to discover operational problems.
* System can't scale to accommodate a large number of users.

After the release, operational issues dominate the mindshare. A company that
may be good at developing new software may stumble during operations. Technical
debt may be to blame for poor financial results and customer satisfaction issues.


### Cultural Debt

The last major category of issues relate to the people aspects of the business.
Software is created by teams of people working together to solve problems. Some
organizations excel by building a great culture while others struggle to get
people to work together at all. Cultural debt can be deeply entrenched and
difficult to resolve. Consider these indicators of cultural debt:

* Planning process is inflexible in the face of changing realities.
* Product plans only consider the current generation.
* Low product quality prevents any leverage.
* Lack of standard practices results in little shared knowledge.
* Lack of tools for sharing information prevents free exchange of ideas.
* No way to manage the required skill sets for the project.
* Staff is afraid and unwilling to share information with others.

These issues are all related to group norms established within your
organization. These group norms are based in the cultural values that dictate
the everyone's daily behavior. The culture can be changed over time, but it
does take a clear plan to do so. In Part 4 we will explore in greater depth how
you can create a culture that supports leverage.


## Recognizing Technical Debt

Learning to recognize technical debt is a critical skill for an architect.
Knowing where to apply energy and resources is a key aspect of steering the
technical direction of the project. This is a place where leadership can shine
and you can have a huge impact on the success of the project. Detecting
problems while they are still small can prevent much greater problems in the
future.


### Organizational Dysfunction and Technical Debt

There is a direct correlation between organizational dysfunction and technical
debt. Dysfunctional organizations create products that are riddled with
technical debt. Excellent teams create excellent products with high quality and
high predictability. This is no accident, good teams utilize good processes that
create good products. In fact, the product quality is a direct reflection of the
organizational quality of the team that produced it.

Culture gets special treatment in this book because building a healthy culture
is a requirement for building good software. There isn't a sick organization
that can consistently produce high-quality software. If you intend to create an
environment that maximizes leverage you must tackle some of the people-related
issues that can block achieving that goal.

The natural order of things is to decay and experience corruption. This is true
of organizations as well as the software they produce. For an organization to
stay healthy it must continue to grow. New ideas and skills must be developed in
order to keep pace with the business demands.

If a team fails to grow in its process skill it will inevitably slide into
dysfunction. The team will lose sight of the primary project goals and become
obsessed with trivial matters. This organizational debt is very similar to the
decay that an unmanaged software system experiences.

Organizational debt is the result of a lack of leadership but a single
champion can have a profound positive impact on a team. Perhaps you are the
champion your organization needs?

When there is organizational dysfunction, each member of the team must make a
choice. "Will I step forward and lead or will I duck for cover"? In the Dilbert
comic strip, Scott Adams describes the Wally character who is on permanent "in
plant vacation". We need fewer Wally's and more leaders who will have the
courage to make necessary changes.

People can accomplish far more working together than working alone so build a
team of like-minded people that can support your efforts. If something works
on your team then share the successful formula with neighboring teams. Spread
the best practices around and try to focus on grassroots support. Over time
you can have a major impact on the effectiveness of your organization.


### Example Scenario

To illustrate how technical debt works in the real world, let us imagine a
mythical company and how some of the project dynamics play out. The Bad News
Herald is a blogging website dedicated to doomsday devotees. Bad News is
founded by three prima donnas with big egos. Each privately harbors the belief
that the other two are inferior, but they choose to work together anyway.

They agree on the basic idea of the business but can't seem to get to closure
on the details. Instead of focusing on gaining a common vision they decide to
write a complete product spec up front. One of the members thinks that this is
a complete waste of time and so begins building the product that matches his
ideas. Eventually he has written enough code that the other two are forced to
abandon their efforts because their product ideas are incompatible.

A choice is made to focus primarily on the feature set to try and get everything
up and running quickly. It is uncertain whether the core infrastructure will
support the kind of traffic they may experience but these issues are pushed
aside in order to add lots of advanced features to the UI. A new technology is
being used that no one is really familiar with but this doesn't dampen their
enthusiasm. They end up disagreeing about the persistence layer so Frank uses
Redis and Bill uses Postgres. They will figure out how to exchange data between
the two later.

When they begin discussing the coding tools there is more disagreement. The
three developers end up using three different editing environments so sharing
all of the tool configurations is out of the question. The version control
process is also quite difficult because they each have a different work style.
One developer adds untested code to the master branch while another maintains
a separate branch that is merged every other month. This makes it nearly
impossible to get a valid build of the code.

Because it is so painful to merge and build the code, the developers each begin
to replicate chunks of code so that they can work independently. Eventually
large chunks of the code become replicated except for the slight changes that
creep in and the time between integration continues to get longer. The test
cycle requires two weeks to create one build worth testing. They decide that a
team of testers is required just to click on the UI. This saves the effort of
writing automatic tests which requires developers. They decide the testing can
be outsourced to an offshore testing firm.

The endeavor continues until finally the group has run out of resources and
time - that's usually when the blaming starts. There are hundreds of decisions
that are made during the course of development and every decision either
raises or lowers the risk level of the project. Risk is measured in technical
debt. The founders of Bad News Herald made every decision in favor of debt.
They steadily accepted more risk throughout the project without understanding
the eventual consequence. Projects like this often end in high turnover and
high personal costs to the team members.

This unfortunate situation happens far too often. People's lives and careers
are ruined by taking on unreasonable risks. There is a time to take on risk but
it must be carefully considered. You must remain conscious of the level of all
types of technical debt that you are taking on and ultimately, you must be
prepared to pay off the debt at some point.


### The Leverage Mindset

Turing Award winner Fred Brooks wrote a brilliant paper in 1986, entitled "No
Silver Bullet — Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering". He pointed out
that there is no sliver bullet for software productivity. No tool, language,
or technology will offer everything we need in a single shot. Yet, today most
engineers are still searching desperately for a panacea that will provide all
of the answers.

While no silver bullets exist, there are some very effective bullets. There
are best practices that produce great results every time. There are tools that
are efficient and ways to manage teams that actually work. There is a body of
knowledge that can be tapped into that will transform your team into a world
class operation. Embracing the concept of constant incremental improvement is
truly adopting a leverage mindset.

While no one thing will fix all your problems, everything you do will help. The
problems are fixed by applying well-known solutions, and it is worth studying
the solutions because the problems are worth fixing. Base your development
practices on techniques that have been proven to work well.


### A Broader Definition of Leverage

Over the last three decades there has been an acknowledgment of the importance
of software reuse. I recently attended a software conference session on software
reuse where the speaker talked exclusively about how to package a library so it
can be used by others. Reusing code without modification is the most restrictive
and, therefore, the least useful form of leverage.

I think this illustrates a problem in our thinking. While reusing packaged
code may save us the effort of rewriting standard functions in common use, it
doesn't go far enough. If we want to use all assets to the greatest advantage
we can't limit our thinking only to reusing code. The leverage mindset forces
us to embrace a much broader concept of reuse and to rethink the multiple
layers of understanding that can be leveraged.

We must be able to leverage:

* customer understanding
* business goals and strategies
* brand recognition
* teamwork and collaboration
* knowledge and skills of team
* project plans
* technology understanding
* architecture
* detailed design
* code
* software development tools and process
* tests and testing strategies
* release tools
* scaling information
* server management techniques and tools

By viewing leverage in the broadest possible terms, we can apply every form of
understanding gained from past experience to future problems. True leverage
occurs in every aspect of problem solving. We are able to recognize the common
patterns and apply appropriate solutions and this yields the productivity gains
that we so desperately need.

## Management of Technical Debt

What if the problem before us is only similar, but not identical, to the one
someone else has solved? Rarely is the problem statement identical for every one
of these aspects. Everything that we do must be adaptable. Our ability to
leverage is based on our ability to apply old solutions to new problems and to
recognize when this produces an advantage for us. In order to maximize
advantage, leverage every part of the intellectual property chain.

The leverage mindset demands that we be pragmatic. To quote Teddy Roosevelt,
"Do what you can, where you are, with what you have." Flexibility is the key
to leverage. We examine the current problem and consult our vast inventory of
tricks to determine which one to use here. Is there a standard solution
already available or should a new solution be created for this situation and
used the next time? This is the leverage mindset.

Understanding is the key asset to leverage. Debt ruins your chance at leverage
because it makes it too difficult to adapt. Have you every worked on a design
that you knew must possess some brilliant virtue but it was rendered unusable by
its flaws? The leverage mindset compels you to abhor technical debt in all of
its forms because is ruins your leverage. A lot of missing tests or defects or
poor structure will destroy any chance of leverage.

Leverage is the key to controlling costs so technical debt can actually be
measured in dollars. Software architects need to build personal skills around
having the budget conversation. "We would like to use that library but it will
cost us 100 hours to replace the database driver with ours. We have 100
defects outstanding which will take 400 hours to solve and there are probably
another 100 still hiding. We are at least 800 hours from release."

You have fully adopted the Leverage Mindset when you believe that your
software can live indefinitely. But to make this happen you will need to align
your development practices to the goal. Lots of people are looking for a "Get
Rich Quick" scheme. The leverage optimization approach is to build practices
that will allow us to get rich slowly. We want to maximize the long-term
business payoff for every hour of work done. Aim to build high-quality
software and make it last forever. Success is producing the highest value for
the lowest effort and leverage is the only way that you will ever get there.


### Measuring Technical Debt

Technical debt is the most significant threat to every software project.
Throughout the development there are thousands of technical trade-offs made.
Each of these trade-offs is a technical problem that must be solved. But a
decision is often made to defer solving a problem at this time. This promise to
work on this issue later produces an IOU for the project.

Technical debt naturally builds over time. Each time a problem is deferred, the
quality of the project has decreased. Managers naturally assume that the
engineers and architects are resolving everything that they encounter. They
believe that the project is proceeding with a low number of unresolved issues.

Software architects and senior engineers can recount numerous discussions with
managers about the need to fix systemic problems within the design. If a
manager rejects an opportunity to authorize refactoring the code, the same
manager is likely to be shocked at the consequences of not resolving the
looming issues early enough.

Metrics are one way that we can measure the health of our software system and
the health of the development process and team. This will enhance
communication and make it much easier to get approval for addressing the
issues before they completely shut down the development progress.

Managers can tell when the software functionality is there. They can see the
steady progress with new features being turned on. They are excited as each new
build produces a pet new feature. Quality, on the other hand, is often invisible
and hard to understand. The compromises made while creating the features are
often unseen. It is difficult to fully appreciate the technical debt that is
accumulating under the hood.

People assume the favorable state. They believe that everything is fine because
that is mostly what they see. The VP of Engineering asks for a product demo and
a team of engineers carefully craft a _happy path_ through the product. Everyone
is delighted and the VP announces the early shipment for the solution. No one
wants to admit that the project is far from release due to the myriad of
unresolved issues. Everyone has a natural reluctance to broadcast or hear the
bad news. Thus, many projects careen toward disaster without notice.


### Managing Technical Debt

Quantitative measurements can replace subjective positioning. The same demo can
be shown to the VP. She can get all excited about the potential of the future
product, but there can also be a presentation of the current realities.

An organization that understands the metrics for success can have a compelling
and accurate story about how this project compares to the performance of the
current product. The story can be clear even in a highly political environment
because problems can be revealed in the actual data.

People will optimize the things that have the most value. People have an
innate desire to win so clarifying what success looks like is a great
motivator. The metrics that we collect should either directly reflect success
or lead to a calculation that does. For example, revenue is a direct indicator
while number of modules must be part of a larger picture.

Reward the things that you value most - people will automatically learn and
adapt to the desired behavior. If you have a highly visible dashboard many
people will experience a competitive desire to play to the dashboard.

This leads to the metrics dilemma. Be careful what you wish for, you just might
get it. If you measure the wrong thing you will get it even if it is actually
harmful to your success. I recall a Dilbert cartoon where Wally learned of a
$100 incentive to engineers for every defect they discovered. Wally says, "I'm
gonna write me a minivan!"


## Best Practice #2 - _Measure and manage technical debt weekly._


***Problem***<br>
Technical debt occurs when we take shortcuts. There are tasks that must be
completed on the project but we have neglected or delayed their completion. The
decision to delay tasks may, or may not, have been conscious but either way it
is an IOU against the project. Some systems are so riddled with debt that the
net worth is negative - it would require more to fix the system than it is worth
to the business.

Most projects have no way to measure their technical debt. Debt naturally
accumulates and requires a concerted effort to eliminate. A poorly constructed
system can decay and fall into disuse within 18 months of its release due to
crippling technical debt.

A large technical debt will block all of the possible leverage for follow-on
projects. The team itself may experience very high turnover due to loss of
confidence in the leadership, resulting in all of the project knowledge being
lost. A project with no leverage can easily cost ten times the expected
budget. A product with excessive debt may even severely damage the company.


***Solution***<br>
Eliminating debt requires being able to measure it. There are many different
types of debt. A dashboard can track the most important debt terms in your
equation. Debt is measured in hours, which can also be translated into monetary
terms, if desired. The total debt represents the unfinished business on your
project and is the sum of all the terms.

The software development process itself is an exercise in debt reduction. At the
end of the project you should have less than 10% debt. A project that ships with
50% debt is really only half done and will fail after a brief time in the
market.

***Next Steps***

* Complete a self-assessment of the types of debt in your current project.
