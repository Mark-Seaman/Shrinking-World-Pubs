## Developing Best Practices

Best practices must be developed because they aren't a natural byproduct of
creating software. It requires a concerted effort to build and share software
processes throughout the organization. A significant part of an architect's
mindshare should be applied to how development should be done, not just
producing the next product.

Leverage is the best way to control the cost of developing software. However,
the flaws within our organizations and our software may block leverage. Technical
debt prevents us from reusing the knowledge that we already have to produce new
products. So how do we escape this dilemma? By developing a standard set of
practices over time. This leaves us free to fully leverage the solutions that
are already proven.

Our primary objective is to produce the maximum amount of software value for the
lowest cost. If software is simply a repeated act of problem solving, then the
cost of the software is related to the number and complexity of the problems
that we choose to solve.


### Pay Off Technical Debt

With a heavy load of technical debt, each problem that we attempt to solve is
difficult. The remaining defects, missing tests, inappropriate data structures
and interfaces, all work against us. It can become quite difficult to even read
and understand the code. In the extreme cases, it can become virtually
impossible to maintain the code. Have you ever been on a project where there was
no one available with any knowledge of how to modify the code successfully? At
that point the code is no longer maintainable. The cost of maintenance is now
higher than the cost of replacement.

There are techniques that will prevent this situation from occurring and the
same methods can be used for restoring health to bad software. They can be
learned and applied by any developer.

Technical debt is the problem and implementing best practices is the solution.
Each ailment has a remedy; each problem has a solution. A best practice is a
recipe for solving a certain problem by applying a known solution.


### Capture Recurring Solutions

As we explore the problems and solutions we'll offer tips for building your
own catalog of best practices. Consider the catalog offered in this book as a
starter kit on which you can build upon. Use the ones that work for you
directly, modify others, and reject the ones that don't make sense for you.
Going through this tutorial will sharpen your awareness of your team's current
software development practices.

As you build your own catalog, share your ideas with your team and with other
people too. By learning and teaching best practices you can multiply the
positive impact within your company. Most organizations are in desperate need
of this type of leadership.


### Catalog of Best Practice

A central repository for standard solutions and best practices is essential.
Eventually you can build out a large system to track all of your practices but
this will take years. It is best to start small with a simple solution.

Each practice can be documented with a simple text template for the key aspects
of the practice:

* Problem - What is the issue that is being solved?  When should this be used?
* Solution - What are the key elements that need to be applied?
* Discussion - What are common issues, variations, and limitations?

Start with a very simple template to encourage engineers to write the practices
down. Remove every excuse and barrier that might prevent someone from
contributing. Once a solution is identified for a particular problem it should
be the standard answer for all future problems of that type. It is important for
the best practices to be shared and universally applied. Otherwise, you are
putting effort into a system that generates no value to the business.

If someone uses a different solution you have three possible responses:

* Add the new solution to the catalog
* Modify the existing solution to include the new twist
* Replace the approved solution with the new one


### Best Practice Collaboration

The system must be easily searchable. A text search and a tagging system makes
it easy for anyone to find what they are looking for in less than a minute. Tags
are better than folders since there may be many ways to retrieve the same
information.

The system should meet the specific needs of your engineers. It might be
integrated in with your source code or built as a stand-alone application. It
should live independently of any specific product.

This system should house all of the latest process information that will teach
your team how to do everything. Think of it as a cookbook of tricks that can
be applied whenever there is a need.

A system to track best practices is a great way to improve your overall
software development process. Pockets of excellence can be spread throughout
the group so that everyone can steadily increase in skill. Software process
knowledge is a key asset in your organization. Measure the size of your
system - it should be growing over time. Measure the growth of different
aspects of your system:

* articles
* words
* authors
* technologies
* code snippets
* tools

This central repository of best practices represents your health as a software
organization. Engineers should be rewarded for contributing to the shared base
of knowledge and they should also be reprimanded for refusing to share their
knowledge. Knowledge hoarding is very destructive.


## Promoting Software Process

An organization based on continual learning will thrive over the long term. Jim
Rohn said, "Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced
every day". Best practices take a long time to develop, but once learned they
should be shared as widely as possible.

Understanding how to build software effectively is one of the most important
assets you have. Build this body of knowledge with each product generation.
Make sure that each team member is aware of the work to build standard
practices. When every individual is fully engaged in building your best
practice inventory rapid progress will be made to grow expertise across the
entire organization.


### Learned and Shared

Start with a simple one page description of how to solve a problem then let
multiple people enhance it until it is the definitive word on the topic. Build
the documentation as you build the knowledge. Complex tasks will require more
description. In this way, you are amortizing the cost of learning new skills
and building an asset that may last for many years.

It is wonderful to be looking at a difficult problem and discover that someone
else has already solved it. Think of the benefit of being able to leverage a
working answer within an hour when the expected effort was several hours of
work. Be generous with your coworkers - leave them a nice solution that will
save them a lot of work. You want to participate on both sides of this equation.

Not all solutions are equally good. It is important that everyone is allowed to
edit the repository of software processes. This provides an environment to
mentor the less skilled developers. You may want to consider adding a voting
mechanism into the system, similar to the one that Stack Overflow uses. This
gives certain ideas greater weight.

Your most skilled engineers should constantly be curating the content of the
system because you are telling all engineers to apply these solutions. The
senior engineers can verify that the solutions are appropriate. Over time, you
will build a set of ground rules about who can edit what content. However, at
the inception be light-handed - there is a bigger danger of the system falling
into disuse than there is of anarchy.

Make contributing practices to the catalog fun. Announce when new contributors
have created their first posting. Make contributing a worthwhile activity. 

When developing new solutions, the first idea is not always the best. Some
ideas require multiple attempts to finally create an elegant solution. The
process recipes in the catalog should withstand scrutiny and review.
Experiment with the ideas to either improve or replace them. Periodically
review the catalog and assign engineers to investigate the processes that
cause the most problems.

Experimentation is the key to developing great solutions. Reviewing a problem
can reveal fresh insight and lead to a better solution. Don't be hesitant to
replace any solution with a superior one - but be sure to test it adequately
over the entire range of possible environments.


### Standardizing Practices

Standard solutions to common problems will lead to predictability. This is one
of the primary goals for standardization: anyone can apply a solution with a
high confidence of getting an acceptable result.

By replacing manual steps in the solution with automation you can increase the
repeatability even further. The computer will execute the steps in exactly the
same way every time. This removes the potential for human error. Of course, the
automation must be thoroughly tested. One advantage to automation is that it is
easy to build the verification directly into the script. For example, if a
process is intended to clear out a directory you can check that there are no
files present when the script ends.

Remember, no panacea exists for software productivity and quality. And yet, we
keep looking for that one magic tool that will make us fly. Perfectly
reasonable people are turned into fanatics when it comes to tools, languages,
frameworks, operating systems, and text editors. But the reality remains - no
one tool or process will meet all our needs.

Although some tools and processes are clearly superior to others, the gain that
we receive is often only a small part of what is promised. A best practice is
any solution that gives us an advantage over the way it used to be done. Stock
your catalog with solutions that work. They might not be silver bullets but they
can still slay the dragon. Use the best ammo you can afford and constantly
develop better ammunition.


### Repeatable Results

Best practices should be developed incrementally. Every process already is being
done in some way today. Start with a short description of the current process.
What steps are being done and what problems aren't adequately addressed? That is
the baseline - build from it and only change one thing at a time.

Avoid the temptation to scrap everything in favor of a new fad. You are already
building software with some degree of success. Use what works and look for 
improvements in the areas of greatest pain.

Move slow and carefully in order to move faster. Change one thing and study the
results. If you find that you have made a mistake then undo the new process.
Once you have identified a clear improvement - use it everywhere. Go through
your entire system and replace the old with the new - don't let multiple
solutions live together over the long term! A temporary, transitional state is
acceptable but multiple solutions to the same problem create confusion with new
developers and should be unified.

A winning solution should also be applied at every future opportunity. There
should be a clear difference in circumstances that should allow an engineer to
choose between two similar solutions to a problem. Part of the documentation for
the solution should include a description of the context in which one solution
is better than another. Try to avoid situations where there are competing
answers that amount to a matter of personal preference.


### Championing Best Practices

Best practices are a vital asset for your organization and can be as important
as the product itself. Software process is the golden goose that will allow you
to create great products in the future. This may seem obvious but many groups
fails to grasp the tremendous importance of good software process. Engineers
commonly find themselves under pressure to take shortcuts in order to meet
unreasonable schedule demands.

The sad truth is that failing to invest in process will only worsen the schedule
crisis. Taking a shortcut will hurt you every time. Not right away, perhaps, but
it will bite you eventually and it usually happens when you can least afford it.

Part of the value that software architects provide to a project is the
judgment of what is good for the long-term health of the software. Evaluate
the true merits of other solutions and be willing to acknowledge the
advantages. Only then, are you in a good position to champion an alternative.
Your confidence should be tempered with humility - people that insist they are
always right have little credibility with others.


## Spheres of Influence: Me, Us, Them

![Spheres of Influence for Best Practices](img/Spheres.png)

Ideas and solutions can be found in a lot of different places. Best practices
must first be leveraged at a personal level before they can be leveraged
effectively at the team level. At the broadest level you have opportunities to
learn from the processes of other teams, groups, and companies.

The first circle of influence is personal, how I develop software. What best
practices govern my development activities? What problems do I currently
understand well? Do I leverage these best practices to the fullest extent I
can? As you gain traction in each sphere of influence it is time to leverage
what you have learned to the next larger group.

The role of an architect includes a mandate to exert a positive influence on
the larger organization. Your impact must be felt far beyond your immediate
work group in order to be successful at your job. The leverage mindset can
have a profound impact on an entire company. The goal is to prove out ideas
and then to influence others to adopt them for the maximum benefit.


### Personal Practices

Before I can contribute anything to my team I must perfect my own craft. Here's
an opportunity for a quick self-assessment - begin to consciously observe how
you develop software and the techniques you use. Awareness is the first step
toward improvement.

Now make a list of standard processes that you frequently use. Think about how
you might teach these skills to a new member of the team. Teaching is the best
way to learn deeply so this step might p be very valuable to you.

Consider investing a couple of hours each day to improve your craft. This, after
all, is real project work. I guarantee that once you begin this practice, it 
will become the most critical part of your work life.

Don't wait for permission to improve your skill. This is your investment into
your career and will benefit both your current and any future employer. This
type of effort is required to stay current in our fast-moving industry. You
should be able to look at your learning agenda and see how you have invested the
400 hours over the last year. A one week annual training class is completely
inadequate for you to build all the skills you need.

The best way to document best practices is as a catalog - you are providing
recipes for a cookbook on how to build software. The book, "Design Patterns",
does an excellent job of demonstrating techniques for documenting many types of
patterns that can be used by others.

Keep the requirement light in order to make it easy to document new practices.
You can always make it heavier once the system is in mainstream use. A best
practice should address three aspects:

* Problem - recognize conditions where this pattern might be beneficial.
* Solution - recipe for creating a successful implementation.
* Discussion - adjustable customizations, limitations, and application notes.

Work to master your own engineering practices before trying to export them. If
you try to share processes that aren't fully developed you could damage your
credibility.


### Team Practices

The next level of process development is to leverage the personal learning to
benefit the rest of your team. You have built a repertoire of tricks and now you
need to share them with your team. You can also benefit from the tricks others
are using. Success attracts its own publicity - find things that work and tell
others why they work for you. They may be willing to apply the idea and give you
some feedback on how to improve it.

By making it easy to capture process information you can build your own catalog
of best practices, custom-tailored to the specific needs of your team. Efforts
to capture new ideas can be ruined by placing too many demands on authors who
intend to submit new best practices. Your initial goal should be to capture the
actual practices of your team. Once you have a good inventory you can go back to
the authors and seek to increase the quality. By then they already have an
investment in the ideas and will be willing to make the needed improvements.

By using this process the idea will be authored by several people and take on
several new champions as a result. Share your system for organizing the best
practices and invite collaboration. Consider hosting a lunch time seminar or
webinar with your coworkers in order to show them the recent progress. Help
people understand the benefits of contributing to the Best Practices system.

A concerted effort of process improvement will take time. Encourage people to
experiment with the ideas and make improvements. A great practice is produced
after many hours of experimentation and thought have been applied.

Where there is pain, there is an opportunity for improvement. If everything is
running fine there is no reason to dedicate effort to make it better. The more
stress that is in your project, the more improvement can be justified. Let the
reality of your situation dictate the level of energy to be invested in process
improvement.

Michelangelo once commented that creating a statue from stone was simply a
matter of removing the extra rock to free the statue that was already inside. I
like to think about software that way. An app wants to come forth and it will
unless something is blocking it. A best practice is nothing more than removing a
challenge that would mar the artwork that is our software. Your next product
might have already been released were it not for the thousand problems that
prevent you from releasing it. Best practices accelerate the transition from
lump to art.


### Industry Practices

Now we are ready to set our vision beyond our own team. We look at how other
groups have solved the same problems that we face. It is important for us to
start by trying to solve problems on our own - only then will we fully
appreciate the attributes of the solution. Software development occurs in a
variety of situations so it is impossible for a general purpose repository of
best practices to be universally applicable.

No one else has your exact problems so your storehouse of best practices should
meet your unique needs. Make full use of the similarities of processes that you
adopt from others but also respect the differences. You can safely ignore
everything that does not apply to your situation. Be sure to adapt the ideas
rather than just adopt them. You will learn a lot as you try to figure out what
actually applies and the end result will match the specifics of your business
needs.

You may incorporate practices from others but the authorship and review is your
responsibility. Create articles that document each practice and try to limit the
text to a single page initially. Make it easy for people to include information
that they find on the Internet but ensure that each idea is adequately reviewed
before it is put forth as a best practice.

Every team has ongoing challenges. Create a list of the significant problems
that you wish to have solved. Prioritize this list and make this "10 Most
Wanted" list the focus of your exploration. Assign your most talented engineers
with a charter to fix these problems. These are the problems that are keeping
you awake at night - finding great solutions will make everyone sleep better.

You can even have some fun with it by running a competition for the solution to
the nastiest problem. Select a real prize to sweeten the pot and align the team
around the benefit of solving your most important problems. This goes a long way
toward building a shared sense of identity. "We are the team that pulls together
and gets things done."

Seek to standardize on the processes that have already been identified to be
best practices. Engineering practice is more than a matter of preference -
developers should use the best possible process for any given task. Learning a
new way to do something that already has a standard solution is a waste of
resources. However, there must also be room to refine existing practices and add
new ones.

A standard practice should be applied universally in a specific context. If our
team chose Git for version control, someone would need a really good reason to
use Subversion. The burden of proof lies on the engineer that wants to promote a
different practice - they have to demonstrate a significant benefit to warrant
the energy necessary for everyone to change. Allowing each engineer to select
their own tools and processes at will produces a lot of waste within the
project. The team must be open to review and improve the practices but once
approved, they shouldn't be ignored.


## Essential Practices for Leverage

Throughout this book we offer best practices that you can apply immediately to
your project. These recommendations will be presented in the chapter that covers
the related issues in depth. Here is your starter kit of best practices.


### Essential Best Practices

The Leverage Principle

* 1 - Make leverage your primary goal.
* 2 - Measure and manage technical debt weekly.
* 3 - Capture, develop, and standardize best practices.

Development

* 4 - Select technologies that will support your leverage goals.
* 5 - Create components with strong encapsulation and standard interfaces.
* 6 - Use a balanced approach to development resulting in minimum code complexity.
* 7 - Use diff testing to generate maximum test coverage.

Operations

* 8 - Build for continuous delivery of software and use end-to-end automation.
* 9 - Build your system from loosely connected services for optimal flexibility and reuse.
* 10 - Automate everything except the decision to deploy.
* 11 - Monitor everything that you care about.

Culture

* 12 - Create a robust system for sharing all types of knowledge.
* 13 - Build healthy teams by investing resources, creating a team manifesto, and tracking team goals quarterly.
* 14 - Make learning a top priority by measuring it, planning for it, investing in it, and rewarding it when it happens.
* 15 - Adjust plans throughout development to capitalize on new learning and track progress weekly.


## Best Practice #3 - _Capture, develop, and standardize best practices._


***Problem***<br>
It takes a lot of time to properly solve a business or technical problem. Once
an optimal solution is invented it should be used to the fullest extent
possible. This can't happen unless there is a standard method to communicate the
problems and solutions.

If there isn't a system to track best practices then each time an engineer runs
into a common problem they must solve it on their own. A lot of wasted learning
goes into solving problems that have already been solved by someone else. This
is really an organizational failure to preserve and utilize knowledge. Standard
solutions should be readily available for common problems. This prevents several
people from spending time solving the same problem, over, and over again.

In addition to the direct time savings, there is also a quality issue. A much
better solution can be developed if there is a high likelihood of using it many
times. A single developer, intending to use the solution once, may choose to add
artificial limitations and constraints. It is better to have a well-defined
solution and apply it repeatedly in every appropriate situation. This allows the
solution to be designed, reviewed, tested, and tweaked.

Training can help individual engineers avoid the common pitfalls of misapplying
the solutions. Without standardizing on best practices there is a significant
loss of leverage and unnecessarily inflated costs for the project. The
unintended result is to force everyone to be an expert and yet, fail to reward
them for it.

***Solution***<br>
A simple system can be created to capture all of the best practices in one
place. Each problem and solution is clearly discussed so that it can be applied
to future situations. The initial description should be simple and only discuss
the core concepts of the practice. This makes it simple to document new
practices. Simplicity is the key to promoting adoption of the system. The first
discussion should be limited to about six paragraphs and explore only the
essential aspects.

Later improvements will add details to the initial description - after there has
been a chance to validate the basic ideas. The catalog will grow in both depth
and breadth as new ideas are added and developed further. Tags will provide easy
access and organization to the best practices and will allow ideas to be
retrieved from multiple groupings. A text search will also offer an easy way to
retrieve the content.

***Next Steps***

* Review your current practices for gathering and sharing best practices.
* Make a list of the best practices that you already have documented.
* Create a list of new best practices that you should be tracking.
* Select the three most important practices and a simple plan for improvements.
* Identify and recruit potential allies for process improvement.
