# Day 88 - Thriving In What I Think

One of the key aspects of thriving mentally is being intentional about the thoughts that run through
my mind. I have realized that my thoughts can greatly impact my emotions and overall well-being. I
make a conscious effort to challenge negative or limiting beliefs and replace them with positive
and empowering thoughts. By managing what I think, I am able to cultivate a more optimistic and
resilient mindset that allows me to navigate life's challenges with grace and optimism.


## I am responsible for my worldview

I have come to understand that my worldview is shaped by my beliefs, experiences, and perceptions.
Rather than blaming external factors for my outlook on life, I take ownership of my worldview and
actively seek to broaden my perspective. I am open to new ideas, willing to question my
assumptions, and strive to see the world through a lens of understanding and empathy. By
acknowledging my responsibility for shaping my worldview, I empower myself to cultivate a mindset
that is conducive to growth and fulfillment.


## I will not try to extract affirmation from others

As I navigate my journey of thriving mentally, I have learned the importance of self-validation.
While external validation can provide temporary satisfaction, I recognize that seeking constant
affirmation from others is not sustainable or healthy. I focus on building self-confidence and
self-compassion, knowing that true fulfillment comes from within. By refraining from seeking
validation from others, I am able to cultivate a sense of self-worth and contentment that is not
dependent on external factors.


## I can't control my circumstances

In my pursuit of mental well-being, I have come to accept that there are certain aspects of life
that are beyond my control. While I may not be able to dictate the circumstances that come my way,
I can control how I respond to them. I choose to approach challenges with a growth mindset, viewing
them as opportunities for learning and personal development. By shifting my focus from trying to
control external factors to managing my internal reactions, I am better equipped to navigate life's
uncertainties with resilience and adaptability.


## Well-being will be my success measure

In my quest for thriving mentally, I have redefined my measure of success. Instead of equating
success with external achievements or material possessions, I now prioritize my mental well-being
as the ultimate indicator of success. I strive to prioritize self-care, mindfulness, and positive
relationships, knowing that true fulfillment comes from nurturing my mental health and emotional
resilience. By making my well-being a priority, I am able to live a more fulfilling and meaningful
life that is aligned with my values and aspirations.


## I will monitor how I spend my time

As I embark on my journey of thriving mentally, I recognize the importance of being mindful of how I
allocate my time and energy. I make a conscious effort to prioritize activities that nourish my
mind, body, and soul, while minimizing exposure to negative influences or toxic environments. By
monitoring how I spend my time, I am able to cultivate a lifestyle that promotes mental clarity,
emotional balance, and overall well-being. I prioritize self-care practices, hobbies, and
relationships that uplift and inspire me, knowing that my time is a valuable resource that deserves
to be invested wisely.
