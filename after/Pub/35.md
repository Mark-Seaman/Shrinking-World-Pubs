# Day 35 - My Kids

## Stacie's legacy


When I think of my late wife Stacie, her legacy is best seen in our kids. Stacie taught us each to
love, and that love continues to be the foundation of our family. Despite her absence, we remain
extremely close and connected.  I know that Stacie would be proud to see us now.

As we navigate this journey of loss and grief, we are learning to lean on each other, finding solace
in our shared experiences and memories. Our children are a testament to Stacie's love, and we know
that she would be proud of the way they have grown and thrived despite the hardships they have
faced. Together, we are forging a new path, honoring Stacie's legacy, and finding healing in our
togetherness.


## Mutual encouragement

Grieving is a personal journey, and everyone handles it differently. But what has helped us
tremendously is the mutual encouragement we provide each other. We understand the pain we are all
experiencing, and we support each other every step of the way. Our interactions are filled with
kindness and respect, creating a safe space for us to express our emotions and thoughts.

In addition to emotional support, we also serve each other practically. Small acts of kindness go a
long way in helping us cope with our loss. Whether it's cooking meals, running errands, or helping
with schoolwork, we step up to ensure that no one feels overwhelmed or alone.


## Experiencing life together

Although the weight of loss is heavy, we make a conscious effort to experience life together as a
family. One tradition we have is our family pizza night, a tradition we've kept alive for the past
four years. It's a time for us to gather, enjoy delicious food, and simply be present with one
another. We cherish these moments, holding onto the memories and creating new ones.

Another way we are embracing life is through an upcoming ocean cruise that Stacie had booked before
she fell ill. We see it as a way to honor her and the adventures she always wanted us to embark on.
It will undoubtedly be a bittersweet experience, but we know she would be proud of us for
continuing to live life to the fullest.

Deep talks about life have become a regular part of our routine. We discuss our dreams, fears, and
aspirations, giving each other a safe space to share our hopes and concerns. These conversations
not only help us feel closer as a family but also provide us with a sense of purpose, as we
navigate life without Stacie.


## Working through loss

The path of grieving is filled with many types of losses. We mourn not only the absence of our loved
one but also the dreams and plans we had for the future. The emotions are intense: anger, fear,
sadness, and shame all intertwine as we grapple with our new reality. But through it all, we have
realized that we are better together. We draw strength from one another, finding comfort in the
fact that we are not alone in our pain.

Whenever we face a difficult decision or are unsure about how to proceed, we often find ourselves
asking, "What would Stacie do?" We know that Stacie would want us to continue living fully,
embracing every opportunity that comes our way. Her spirit lives on in us, guiding us through the
challenges and reminding us to find joy in the midst of sorrow.
