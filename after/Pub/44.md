# Day 44 - Stacie's Final Tour

## December 20, 2024

I didn't intend to go on a tour, it just happened. In retrospect, it is the only thing I could have
done.  Stacie has been gone a week now and we are working on planning her memorial. 

Stacie's sudden departure left me grappling with a whirlwind of emotions. Little did I know that it
would turn into a poignant journey down memory lane. The weight of her absence loomed heavy as I
tried to fathom a life without her by my side.

## The Funeral Home and Our Old House

The first stop was the funeral home to pick up Stacie's remains and the death certificates. The
funeral home was located just a couple of blocks from our old house in Greeley. 


## Revisiting Our Old House

The car automatically took me to visit our old house. I stood for a while and looked at the house
that Stacie and I built, the house where we raised our kids, the house where we lived for 17
years.

I designed the floor plan for the house and we had a contractor build it.  Our kids were 11, 8, and
5 when we moved in and 28, 25, and 22 when we moved out.  There was a park across the street from
the house. I parked the car and walked around the neighborhood. The whole place held the echoes of
our shared history.

Standing outside the familiar walls, I was flooded with memories of the life we had built together.
From raising our kids to simply being present for each other, every corner of that house whispered
tales of love and laughter that we had shared for years.

We moved to Windsor 14 years ago when Stacie bought me a dream house for my 50th birthday.  I had 
only been back to our old house a few times since.  I was struck by how quickly life passes by.


## Our First House in Greeley

The car effortlessly guided me to our first home in Greeley, nestled
next to Woodbriar Park.  When we moved to Colorado we had a 3 year old and a newborn. The house
had seven giant cottonwood trees that were all gone now.

We bought the house when we first moved to Greeley. I was struck by the changes that time had
wrought upon the familiar landscape. Those seven years spent in that house were the beginning of
our life in Colorado.

At that time I worked in the brand new HP factory that has recently been bulldozed.  This is a
stark reminder that nothing lasts forever.


## Reminiscing at Fat Albert's

The car eventually brought me to Fat Albert's, a relic of our past that stood as a testament to our
shared history. This classic restaurant held within its walls the memories of our first days in
Colorado, when we were embarking on a new chapter in our lives. As I savored a slice of cherry pie
that rivaled even my mother's, I couldn't help but smile at the bittersweet nostalgia that
enveloped me. Stacie and I had indeed lived a wonderful life filled with cherished moments.

Stacie and I always split the Avocado club sandwich with potato skins.  We knew before we arrived
at Fat Albert's what we would get.  So it was only appropriate to get the same.


## Gratitude Amidst Loss

As I navigated through these familiar places that held the essence of our shared past, gratitude
intertwined with grief in a poignant dance. The journey not only served as a testament to the love
we had shared but also as a gentle reminder of the fragility of life. In the midst of loss, I found
solace in the memories that adorned every corner of our journey together.

Each place I visited held within it a piece of our shared story, a fragment of the tapestry that we
had woven together over the years. In retracing our steps, I found a sense of peace amidst the
turmoil of grief. Stacie may no longer be by my side, but her presence lingered in every memory,
every shared moment that we had treasured together. In these memories, I found the solace to carry
on, knowing that love endures even in the face of loss.

I find it so hard to understand how Joy and Sorrow can mix together, but they do.  The intense
sorrow I feel is combined with the gratitude of a life well lived.
