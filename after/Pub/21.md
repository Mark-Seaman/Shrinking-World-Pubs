# Day 21: Surrounded by Love

Stacie and I booked a month-long ocean cruise shortly before she fell ill.  
With her recent death I had no desire to travel alone.
What had been a reminder of loss has now been turned into joy.

Two of my children, Josiah and Rachel have agreed to accompany me on a Scandinavian cruise that
Stacie and I had booked in October for the month of May. What was once a reminder of loss has now
become a beacon of joy and healing.

To say that I am grateful is an understatement. Having two of my kids by my side on this trip means
more to me than words can express. Their presence fills the void that Stacie's absence has left,
and witnessing their unwavering love and support touches me at the deepest level of my being. It
reminds me that even in the face of tragedy, there is still love and light to guide us forward.

But it is not just my children who have reached out to me during this challenging time. The
outpouring of love and support from my friends and family has been overwhelming. I am truly humbled
by the kindness and generosity that so many have shown me. Their acts of compassion have reminded
me that I am not alone in my grief, that there are people who care deeply about my well-being.

I am surrounded by love. I am surrounded by support. And in this realization, I find solace and
comfort. The pain of losing Stacie is still very real, but it is not all-encompassing. Through the
kindness of others, I am reminded that life continues and that there is still beauty to be found in
this world.

As I embark on this cruise with my kids and carry the memories of Stacie in my heart, I am
filled with a sense of gratitude and awe. I am reminded of the blessings that surround me, both big
and small. The love I have received from my children, friends, and even strangers has truly touched
my soul. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of love to heal even
the deepest wounds.

In this moment, I realize that I am not just a recipient of love but also a witness to its
transformative power. The kindness shown to me has opened my eyes to the immense capacity for
compassion that exists within each of us. It is a lesson I plan to carry with me as I continue to
navigate this journey of healing and growth.

Though my heart still aches, I am grateful for the love that surrounds me. It has given me strength,
hope, and a renewed sense of purpose. I am not alone in my pain, and for that, I am eternally
grateful.

Today, I am reminded that even in the darkest of times, there is always light. I am reminded that
love has the power to guide us through our grief and into a future filled with hope. And I am
reminded that, no matter what may come, I am truly blessed.
