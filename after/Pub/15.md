# Day 15: A Step Toward Freedom

As 2023 unfolded, Stacie and I found ourselves caught in a web of never-ending work hours.
We had become overcommitted and felt trapped, by our busy schedules. Sadly,
this meant canceling not one, but three family vacations that we had eagerly planned and were
longing for.

By the time October rolled around, Stacie and I had reached a breaking point. We both acknowledged
the fact that our lives had become a monotonous grind, devoid of any joy or personal fulfillment.
It was clear to us that we needed to shift our focus away from constantly working for others, and
instead start prioritizing our own happiness.

Together, we made the life-altering decision to retire from our careers. With the prospect of
transitioning to Medicare next year, it felt like the perfect opportunity to finally step off the
hamster wheel of work. 

I had already retired several times but it never took.   I found myself at age 64 working harder 
than I had ever done in my entire career.  I had a hard policy to limit work to an average of 40 hours
per week with a maximum of 50 hours for a short burst.

But now I was working 60 hours every week trying to maintain three full-time careers.  Each career 
was important to me and was unwilling to give anything up.  Stacie and I were writing a software
application that would run a university registration system.  I was writing books and class and
teaching college. I found myself in a death spiral.

We were determined to reclaim our lives from the clutches of work. No longer did we want our careers
to consume every waking moment. We wanted to embark on a new chapter, one that would allow us to
savor the simple pleasures and pursue activities solely for our own enjoyment.

Retirement, for us, signified more than just the end of our working lives - it was a gateway to
freedom. A chance to rediscover ourselves, invest in our passions, and nurture our relationships
without the weight of professional responsibilities holding us down.

As we took this leap of faith towards retirement, we knew it would bring about countless changes and
challenges. Yet, we were willing to face them head-on. The sacrifices made and the struggles
endured on our journey would pale in comparison to the fulfillment and happiness we hoped to
achieve.

Our decision to retire was not a surrender to age but rather a declaration of self-worth. It was an
affirmation that our lives should be defined by the moments we cherish, the experiences we savor,
and the connections we foster, rather than the countless hours we spent toiling away.

With the promise of retirement on the horizon, we eagerly embraced the new chapter that awaited us.
We were ready to bid farewell to the incessant demands of work and embrace a life filled with
purpose, mindfulness, and the freedom to pursue what truly matters.

As the year drew to a close, we eagerly counted down the days until our retirement would become a
reality. It was time to step away from the chaos and noise of the working world and embrace a
slower, more intentional pace of life. The future held endless possibilities, and we were ready to
seize them with open arms.
