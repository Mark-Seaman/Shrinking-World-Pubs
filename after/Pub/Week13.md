# Week 13 - Process of Transformation

## [Day 85 - My New Life](/after/85.md)          

In this new chapter of my life, I am focused on four key areas: behavior, relationships, beliefs, and emotions. I have
learned that what I do, say, think, and feel all play a crucial role in shaping my reality. By consciously aligning
these aspects of myself with my highest good, I have been able to create a life that is fulfilling and abundant.


## [Day 86 - Thriving In What I Do](/after/86.md)

Here are some guidelines to allow me to select actions that are balanced.  How I spend my time and energy is critically
important to my well-being.


## [Day 87 - Thriving in Relationships](/after/87.md)           

How I interact with others is a key to my well-being.  I must be intentional about my relationships. Not only how I
interact with others but also who I choose to spend time with.


## [Day 88 - Thriving In What I Think](/after/88.md)    

My thought life is also critical to my well-being.  I am responsible for what I think and believe. I must be intentional
about what I believe to be true and what I expose my mind to.  I must challenge negative thoughts and replace them with
positive ones.  I must be willing to examine my beliefs and change them if they are false.


## [Day 89 - Emotional Health](/after/89.md)             

Emotional health is my responsibility.  I must be willing to feel my emotions and express them.  At the same time I
cannot be overwhelmed by negative emotions.  There must be limits to my emotional expression and the role that feeling
play in my life.  


## [Day 90 - Road to Transformation](/after/90.md)

Personal transformation is a lifelong journey.  It is a process of growth and change.  I must be willing to embrace the process
and be open to the lessons that life has to teach me.  I must be willing to learn from my mistakes and be open to new
experiences.  I must be willing to take risks and step out of my comfort zone.  I must be willing to let go of old habits
and beliefs that no longer serve me.  I must be willing to be vulnerable and authentic.  I must be willing to be patient
and persistent and willing to trust the process and have faith that I am on the right path.  


## [Day 91 - From Death to Life](/after/91.md)

After the most devestating losses of my life I am finally coming back to life.  Recently I have seen a fresh security, sense of
identity, peace, hope and joy.  My new life is only 90 days old yet these things that I have longed for are already here.  I
expected the journey to take far longer.
