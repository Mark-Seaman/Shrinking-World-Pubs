# Grief Support Group

After the devastating loss of my beloved wife, Stacie, I have been on a journey that has taught me a
great deal about grief. The pain of losing someone we love is universal, and the experience of
grief is deeply personal. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and it can leave us feeling
isolated and alone. But I have come to realize that we don't have to face this journey alone. 

In the midst of our pain and longing for our loved ones, we have found solace and strength in each
other. We have formed a grief support group, a community of individuals who have experienced
profound loss and understand the depths of our grief. Together, we have embarked on a healing
journey, where we can openly share our thoughts, emotions, and memories of our loved ones. 

The grief support group meets on the first Saturday of every month.  First meeting

- Feb 3 - 5:00-7:00
- 404 Crystal Beach Dr, Windsor, CO
- Agenda: talk and pray together
- Childcare provided

This safe and inclusive space allows us to come together, to talk and pray together, and to provide
comfort and understanding to one another. Whatever stage of grief we are in, we can find solace and
connection within this group.

One of the most valuable aspects of our grief support group is the assurance that we are not alone.
All of us become members of this club we never wanted to join, but together we can navigate the
uncharted territory of grief. Each person in the group understands the unique pain and challenges
we face on a daily basis. This shared understanding bonds us together as a resilient and
compassionate community.

Another important aspect of our support group is the provision of childcare during our sessions. We
understand that attending a grief support group may pose logistical challenges for some
individuals, especially those with children. By offering childcare services, we want to ensure that
everyone can participate in the group without any added burdens or obstacles.

Our grief support group is a testament to the power of human connection and the healing potential of
shared experiences. Through these gatherings, we have found the understanding, empathy, and support
we desperately need. While no one can take away our pain or bring back our loved ones, we can find
comfort in knowing that we can lean on each other during the darkest moments of our grief.

If you are navigating the painful journey of grief, we invite you to join our grief support group.
Together, we can find hope, healing, and a sense of camaraderie through the shared understanding of
our collective loss. Remember, you don't have to grieve alone - we are here for you, ready to
listen, support, and hold your hand as we navigate this difficult path together.

Please mark your calendars for the first Saturday of every month, starting from February 3. We look
forward to welcoming you into our grief support group, where healing begins when we come together.
