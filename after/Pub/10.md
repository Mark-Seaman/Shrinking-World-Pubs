# Day 10: My Social Director

Relationships are the cornerstone of our lives. We rely on them for support, love, and companionship. But what happens
when our main source of connection is suddenly gone? How do we navigate the complex world of social interactions?

In my case, I was lucky enough to have Stacie by my side. She was naturally inclined towards building and nurturing
relationships, making her the perfect social director for our lives. While she handled all our social planning and
interactions, I took charge of more task-oriented aspects of our lives. It was a division of labor that worked well for
us for decade. I CREATE and she RELATES.

However, with Stacie's untimely departure, I found myself faced with the challenge of continuing to have meaningful
social interactions. Without her guidance, I was in danger of becoming isolated and devoid of the connections I so
desperately needed.

I am in the process of rebuilding my social life, and I've established a set of guidelines to help me navigate this.
Evaluating my social interactions through the lens of these guidelines has helped me to forge deeper connections and
find meaning in my relationships. I've realized that I need to be more intentional about my social interactions,
focusing on those that bring me joy and fulfillment.

Social guidelines for my new life

- Have 2 deeply meaningful conversations each day
- Avoid large groups where meaningful conversation is not likely
- Avoid interactions that are small-talk
- Renew old friendships that have been neglected
- Spend more time with my kids and grandkids
- Use Marco Polo to stay in daily contact with groups of people
- Prune casual interactions and relationships

Most of these guidelines focus on self-awareness and prioritizing those relationships that are life-giving.
Each day, I strive to become more self-aware in my relationships. It's not always easy; grief has a way
of clouding our emotions and making it difficult to connect with others. But I remain committed to my guidelines,
knowing that they are essential for my own well-being and happiness.

In a world where loss can easily lead to isolation, I refuse to let it define me. Stacie may no longer be here to guide
my social interactions, but she has left behind a legacy of love and connection that I carry with me. Through deliberate
effort and a commitment to forging deeper connections, I am slowly but surely rebuilding my social life.

We all deserve to thrive in relationships, even in the face of loss. By taking the necessary steps and prioritizing
meaningful connections, we can find solace and strength in our shared humanity. And in doing so, we honor the memory of
those we have lost and create a brighter future for ourselves.
