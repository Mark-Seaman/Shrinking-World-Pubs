# Day 16: Retiring For Real

For the past decade, we have been living in a state of economic retirement. Despite not making any
substantial money during this time, we have managed to find contentment in our situation. However,
this year has proven to be particularly challenging as I tried to juggle three full-time careers,
working an exhausting 60 hours a week. I was pushing myself to the limit, and unfortunately, my
wife Stacie had been pulled into this relentless cycle as well.

In October we made a decision that would change the course of our lives. We
concluded that once the academic year came to a close, I would bid farewell to my position as a
professor at the university where I had spent seven years of my life. It was time to retire from my
college professor days. Additionally, our involvement in developing application software through
Prometa would be scaled back to just one day a week for each of us, down from the four days we had
been investing.

Despite these changes, I had built an online school and had every intention of continuing to produce
classes. However, there would be a significant shift in our approach. We decided to relinquish the
pressure of selling these classes. Instead, our focus would be solely on creating them, allowing us
to pursue our passion without the worry of generating income. This decision not only marked the end
of our financial dependence but also signaled the end of the overwhelming stress that comes with
working for others. From now on, we would only engage in creative work on our own terms.

By early December we would have a new life together.  I would start working less than 40 hours weekly
since we had a lot of lost ground to make up for.  We would no longer allow ourselves to be
trapped in a cycle of overcommitment and stress.  We would live free!

The significance of this retirement was difficult to put into words. It was a moment of liberation,
where the weight of expectations and demands of work was lifted from our shoulders. We finally
had the opportunity to define our own schedules, prioritize our well-being, and pursue our passions
without compromise. This newfound freedom brought a sense of peace and tranquility that we had
longed for.

Retirement for us wasn't simply about financial freedom, it was about reclaiming our lives and
taking control of our professional paths. We were stepping away from the traditional idea of
retirement and instead embracing our own version. Our decision allowed us to strike a balance
between work and personal life, enabling us to focus on what truly mattered to us.

The road ahead may be filled with uncertainties, but we were prepared to face them head-on. As we
embarked on this new chapter, we were excited to see where it would lead us. Retiring for real was
not just a declaration, but a commitment to ourselves to live a life that was authentic,
fulfilling, and aligned with our own values.
