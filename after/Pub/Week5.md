# Chapter 5: Support Network

## [Day 29 - Grief Support Group](29.md)

Experiencing intense grief can be an isolating and overwhelming experience. It's important to remember that you don't
have to navigate this journey alone. Building a support network can provide comfort, understanding, and strength during
the darkest moments of grief. Whether it's family, friends, or a professional support group, having a network of people
who care about you can make a world of difference.


## [Day 30 - Building My Social Circles](/after/30.md)

After the loss of a loved one, it's common to feel disconnected from the world around you. Building and maintaining
social connections can help you feel less alone and provide a sense of belonging. I've been working on building my
social circles by reflecting on the relationships that matter most to me and taking steps to nurture those connections.


## [Day 31 - Casual Friends and Acquaintances](/after/31.md)   

Casual friends and acquaintances can play an important role in our lives, especially during difficult times. While they
may not be as close as family or best friends, they can still provide support, companionship, and a sense of community.
Regular communication is the key to staying in touch with a large group of people.


## [Day 32 - Friends and Family](/after/32.md) 

Friends and family are often the first people we turn to for support during times of grief. They can provide comfort,
emotional support, and practical help as we navigate the challenges of loss. I've been reflecting on the importance of
these relationships and the ways in which they have supported me through my grief journey.


## [Day 33 - My Support Network](/after/33.md) 

Building a support network is an essential part of the healing process after the loss of a loved one. While grief can 
isolate us, having a network of people who care about us can provide comfort, understanding, and strength. 


## [Day 34 - Mentors](/after/34.md)       

Mentors can play a valuable role in our lives, providing guidance, support, and wisdom as we navigate the challenges of
grief and loss. I've been building a plan for the mentors in my life, and I'm excited to see how their guidance will 
help me grow and heal.


## [Day 35 - My Kids](/after/35.md)                                              

Stacie's legacy lives on in our children. They are a constant source of joy, love, and inspiration. We've been closer than
ever as we navigate the challenges of grief together. I'm grateful for their love and support, and I'm committed to
nurturing our relationship as we continue to heal and grow.
