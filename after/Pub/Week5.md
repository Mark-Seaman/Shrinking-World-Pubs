# Week 5: Support Network

## [Day 29 - Grief Support Network](29.md)

Experiencing intense grief can be an isolating and overwhelming experience. It's important to remember that you don't
have to navigate this journey alone. Building a support network can provide comfort, understanding, and strength during
the darkest moments of grief. Whether it's family, friends, or a professional support group, having a network of people
who care about you can make a world of difference.
