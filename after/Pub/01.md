# Day 1: Embracing Life After Death?

Do we continue to exist after death? I certainly hope so because I feel like I've lost my life
recently. It all ended when my beloved partner lost her battle with cancer. From the time of her
diagnosis to her last breath, only six weeks had passed. It's still hard for me to fully comprehend
that she's gone.

Ever since our first kiss at the age of 15, she has been at the center of my world. She was the
person I trusted with everything. Every aspect of my life today is a direct result of Stacie. We
made decisions together and shared one mind and heart between us.

The memorial service took place three days ago, so it must be true that she's no longer here. The
days leading up to it were incredibly busy, filled with communication, logistics, and gathering
videos for the event. We had 42 people travel from out of state, and we hosted several large
parties to honor her.

Now the crowds have dispersed. I am alone, surrounded by those I love. The life I knew has come to
an end. But is there still a life for me after death? I believe there is, but it will take time to
navigate through the aftermath and rebuild my life.

It's New Year's Day, 2024. Today marks the beginning of the rest of my life. Day 1: Embracing Life
After Death. The most pressing priority for me now is to find hope that life can start anew. My
previous life was built around Stacie, but this new chapter will have to be built without her,
although it will benefit from her lasting legacy.

As a writer, I find solace in words. I struggle to process my emotions on their own. They often
manifest as chaotic spirits wreaking havoc in my mind. But when I attempt to describe
scientifically what is happening within me, the burden shifts from my emotions to reason, from the
limbic system to the pre-frontal cortex.

I believe that I will find a new life and that writing will play a significant role in my personal
journey. I intend to chronicle the process of rebuilding. This will primarily serve as a tool for
my own healing, but it may also prove helpful to others grappling with loss and suffering.

Every person will experience significant loss at some point in their lives. It is an unavoidable
part of our existence. However, when it strikes, it always takes us by surprise. It feels unjust,
cruel, and brutal. It fills us with anger and shakes the foundations of our beliefs. Despite this,
we are left to face it alone, even though every person will experience their own share of immense
loss.
