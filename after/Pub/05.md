# Making Decisions 

Losing a loved one is undoubtedly one of the most challenging experiences one can face in life. It
shatters our world and leaves us grappling with an array of emotions. In my own journey of grief, I
found that the process of decision-making became increasingly difficult, as I was forced to make
choices on my own.

My late partner, Stacie, and I always made decisions together. It had become a rule we lived by,
considering the dynamics of our personalities. I was the one who made decisions quickly, driven by
my MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) J personality traits. On the other hand, Stacie had a more
thoughtful and deliberate approach to decision-making, in line with her MBTI P personality traits.
We were a perfect balance of risk taker and risk averse.

For me, making decisions was liberating and empowering. Even if it meant making the wrong choice, I
preferred to take action rather than face the paralysis of indecision. Stacie, on the other hand,
found decision-making to be daunting and restrictive. She would rather make no choice at all than
risk making a mistake.

However, the reality of Stacie's passing has presented me with a significant dilemma. I am now faced
with the task of making decisions entirely on my own, and I must adapt to a slower and more
cautious approach, contrary to my natural inclination.

Since her death, I have been bombarded with countless decisions, ranging from trivial and reversible
to critical and irreversible. The weight of these choices is not lost on me, and I am aware of the
need to deliberate carefully before reaching any conclusions.

Fortunately, I am blessed to have a network of trusted individuals who serve as a counterbalance to
my impulsive nature. These are the people to whom I turn for guidance and support in making major
decisions. Their input and approval are crucial to my decision-making process, as I have learned to
value their perspectives and insights.

In acknowledging the necessity of making decisions, I also recognize the potential dangers of
rushing into choices without fully considering the consequences. Accountability is now a
cornerstone of my decision-making process. Knowing that I alone am responsible for the outcomes of
my choices provides a degree of safety and security. It forces me to approach decision-making with
caution and thoughtfulness, accepting the reality that I must face the repercussions of my
actions.

The grief journey is a challenging one, and the process of decision-making can be particularly
daunting. However, by seeking support from trusted individuals and embracing accountability, I can
make informed choices that move me forward in the healing process. Through it all, I am learning that
decision-making after loss is not about erasing the past, but rather about forging a new path
forward while honoring the memories of my beloved partner.
