# Day 48 - My True Identity

I believe that destiny is shaped by our true identity. This identity is made up of our personality,
strengths, and experiences. For me, my true self is reflected in my abilities as a creative problem
solver, a writer, a teacher, a software creator, and an innovator. These aspects of myself bring me
joy and fulfillment, and they are integral to who I am at my core.

If I am able to live out this true identity I will ultimately fulfill my destiny.  This sense of
completion has far more to do with who I am and how I see myself than my accomplishments or the 
actions that I take.  I do wonderful things only because I am the person I am supposed to be.


## My False Identity

However, there is another side of me that I often struggle with – my false identity. This false self
is characterized by traits such as pride, arrogance, narcissism, and a tendency to be domineering
and controlling. These qualities can lead me down a path of isolation and loneliness, as they
create barriers between myself and others. It can be challenging to confront this side of myself,
but I know that acknowledging it is the first step towards growth and change.

Trying to live someone else's destiny is a guaranteed way to fail at my own.  There are things that
I wish were true about my life.  But acceptance of what is true lets me gain the self-awareness that
I need to live authentically.


## Constant Battle

I find myself caught in a constant battle between my true identity and my false self. I often see
repeated patterns in my behavior that stem from my false identity, and it can be disheartening to
feel like I am not fully living up to my true potential. However, I also recognize that the choice
to embrace my true self and reject my false identity is ultimately mine to make.


Every day presents me with the opportunity to choose who I want to be. I can either give in to the
negative aspects of my false identity or strive to embody the best version of myself. This requires
self-reflection, humility, and a willingness to confront my flaws and shortcomings. It is a journey
that is ongoing and requires constant effort and dedication.


## Discernment

In order to navigate the complexities of my true and false identities, I must practice discernment.
This involves being honest with myself about my thoughts and actions, seeking feedback from others,
and staying true to my values and beliefs. It also means being open to growth and change, and being
willing to learn from my mistakes and shortcomings.

Many people struggle over how to hear from God.  For me this has always been amazingly clear.  In
my imagination I am guided by two powerful voices that are quite distinct. One is the angry voice
of the ego that wants to get my way and hurt others to help myself.  The other voice is one of
compassion, mercy, and sacrifice.  THere is no mistaking the voices, and it is only self-deception
that tries to blend them.  The false self and the true self speak with a very different accent.


## Yielding to God

Ultimately, I believe that yielding to God can help
guide me towards a more authentic expression of my true self. By surrendering my false identity and
trusting in God’s plan for my life, I am able to find peace and purpose in my journey towards
self-discovery and personal growth. Being aligned with my true identity and letting go of my false
self allows me to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.
