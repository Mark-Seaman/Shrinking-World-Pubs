# Day 11: Group Gatherings

For some individuals, socializing and connecting with others in large groups is a source of joy and fulfillment. The
excitement of a bustling crowd, the energy of multiple conversations, and the ability to mingle with a diverse range of
people can be invigorating. However, there are those, like myself, who find solace in more intimate settings and
struggle when faced with the prospect of group gatherings.

To me, the saying "the more the merrier" doesn't quite ring true. Anything beyond a group of four feels overwhelming and
disorienting. My desire to engage in meaningful conversations becomes challenging in a large crowd. The multitude of
voices blending together makes it difficult to focus on one person or to truly immerse myself in a discussion. Instead,
I often find myself waiting for the event to be over, longing for the quietude and intimacy that smaller groups offer.

In my ideal social dynamic, the group size ranges from two to four individuals. This allows for a more intimate setting
where deep conversations can flourish. Small talk, despite its commonality in social settings, holds little appeal to
me. Instead, I cherish those moments when I can delve into profound discussions, where ideas, hopes, dreams, and fears
can be openly shared.

Trust is a crucial aspect of any relationship, be it with friends, family, or even acquaintances. For me, trust is built
through heart-to-heart conversations. It is within these vulnerable moments that a strong bond can develop. I struggle
to place my trust in others without first having these intimate exchanges. Small talk, in this regard, feels like a
social burden that prevents the genuine connection necessary for trust to flourish.

Furthermore, I often find myself wrestling with social norms that others seem to effortlessly understand. Social
gatherings, with their unspoken rules and expectations, can leave me feeling out of place and anxious. I long for a
deeper level of connection with others, one that transcends surface-level interactions and embraces our shared
vulnerabilities.

While some individuals thrive in large group settings, finding joy in the liveliness and diversity they offer, others,
like myself, gravitate towards smaller, more intimate circles. We seek out meaningful conversations, build trust through
deep connections, and struggle with the constraints of social norms. It is within these smaller groups that we find
comfort and a sense of belonging, where we can truly be ourselves and forge bonds that hold true meaning.
