# Anger: The Energy of Control

## My History with Anger

For many years, anger was my go-to emotion. It was like an old friend, always there when I needed it. Anger fueled my
actions and gave me the energy to push through obstacles, driven by a belief that I could change the world if I just
exerted enough control. When I was angry, I felt powerful, invincible even, as if nothing could stand in my way. But
over time, I began to realize that this anger, rooted in pride and a sense of entitlement, was not the strength I
thought it was. Instead, it was a destructive force that often led to frustration, bitterness, and broken relationships.

After experiencing the greatest trauma of my life, I found that my relationship with anger changed. The intense emotions
that came with the trauma — pain, loss, fear — were overwhelming, and anger became an even more prominent response. It
was easier to be angry than to confront the deep sadness or fear that lurked beneath the surface. Anger provided a sense
of control in a world that suddenly felt uncontrollable.

## Humility

But the truth is, this anger was not serving me. It was keeping me locked in a cycle of pain, preventing me from healing
and moving forward. I realized that if I didn’t actively manage my anger, it would continue to dominate my life and
hinder my recovery. The first step in this journey was a simple, yet profound admission: I am not God. I am not in
control of everything, and I don’t have to be.

This act of humility — recognizing that I am not the master of the universe, that I am broken and in need of
transformation — was life-changing. It was a turning point that allowed me to see my anger for what it really was: a
defense mechanism that was no longer serving its purpose. Instead of giving me power, it was draining me, keeping me
stuck in a place of hurt and frustration.

Actively managing my anger as part of my healing process involves several key practices. The first is self-awareness.
I’ve learned to recognize the early signs of anger—the tightness in my chest, the quickening of my breath, the racing
thoughts. By identifying these signals, I can catch the anger before it spirals out of control. It’s not always easy,
but with practice, I’ve become more attuned to my emotional state.


## Awareness

Another important practice is mindfulness. When I feel anger rising, I take a moment to pause and breathe. This simple
act of slowing down allows me to step back from the intensity of the emotion and gain perspective. It helps me to see
the situation more clearly, without the cloud of anger distorting my judgment. I ask myself, “What am I really feeling?
What is the underlying emotion driving this anger?” Often, I find that beneath the anger lies fear, sadness, or
hurt—emotions that are more difficult to confront but necessary for true healing.

I’ve also learned the importance of healthy expression. Instead of letting anger fester inside, I find constructive ways
to release it. Sometimes this means talking to a trusted friend or therapist, someone who can listen without judgment
and help me process my emotions. Other times, it involves physical activity. These outlets allow me to channel the
energy of anger in a way that doesn’t harm myself or others.


## Forgiveness

Finally, I practice forgiveness — both for myself and for those who have hurt me. Holding onto anger often means holding
onto grudges, and that weight can be unbearable. By choosing to forgive, I release the need to control the situation or
seek revenge. I let go of the anger and, in doing so, create space for peace and healing.

In the end, managing anger is not about suppressing it or pretending it doesn’t exist. It’s about acknowledging it,
understanding it, and then choosing how to respond. It’s about letting go of the need for control and embracing the
humility that comes with being human. And in that humility, I’ve found a path to healing—a path that leads not only to
peace but also to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me.
