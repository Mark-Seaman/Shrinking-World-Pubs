# Day 34 - Mentors

## Embracing brokenness

I never truly understood the depth of brokenness until I experienced the devastating loss of my dear
wife, Stacie. Her death shook me to the core and forced me to face the harsh reality of my own
brokenness. It was a humbling experience, one that I struggled with but ultimately came to
embrace.

In the midst of my grief, I realized that healing could only come if I approached it with humility.
Denying the reality of my brokenness would be foolish; instead, I had to confront it head-on. It
was through this acceptance that I began to find the path towards healing and redemption.


## Pit crew

One day, as I confided in a friend about my struggles, he shared with me the concept of a pit crew.
He explained that we all need a team of individuals to support us during the difficult times, like
a race car driver who relies on their pit crew to make quick and necessary repairs. These
individuals can include a counselor, psychiatrist, pastor, spiritual director, or trusted advisor.

Inspired by this idea, I made the decision to build my own pit crew. I sought out professionals and
mentors who could fill the blind spots in my life and guide me through the pain and growth. Each
member of my pit crew brings a unique perspective and skill set, allowing me to address different
aspects of my brokenness. They have become my pillars of support, offering insights and guidance
that I could not find within myself.


## Personal board of directors

This group of mentors and advisors can be thought of as my personal board of directors. These are
the individuals I trust with my life and rely on for guidance in every decision I make. Whether
it's a major life choice or a simple everyday dilemma, I seek their input before moving forward.

Each member of my personal board of directors is fully committed to my well-being. They share my
burden and help to carry me through the darkest moments. They serve as my lifeline, offering me a
sense of stability and direction even in the midst of chaos. When a crisis hits, they are the ones
I turn to, knowing they will be there for me without judgment or hesitation.


## Turn-about is fair play

Having experienced the transformative power of mentors firsthand, I have also become a mentor to
others who are going through their own struggles. I have learned that everyone needs someone to
have their back. By investing my time and energy into guiding and supporting others, I am paying
forward the incredible support I have received.

I am forever grateful for those who have been my mentors, walking alongside me during my darkest
days. Their investment in my life has made all the difference, and now it is my turn to give back.
Through mentoring, I aim to be a source of strength and encouragement for those who are going
through their own journey of healing and restoration.

Mentors play a crucial role in embracing our brokenness and finding a path towards healing. By
surrounding ourselves with a pit crew or a personal board of directors, we gain the support,
guidance, and wisdom necessary to navigate the complexities of life after loss. And in turn, by
becoming mentors ourselves, we pay tribute to those who have invested in us and honor the
transformative power of mentorship.
