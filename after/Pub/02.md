# Day 2: Illness Challenge

It was bound to happen eventually. I knew that at some point, I would get sick. This was a reality I had accepted, especially given the current circumstances with the constant presence of illness all around us - COVID-19 and influenza lingering like a shadow.

Ever since Stacie's passing, I had isolated myself from the world, solely for her protection. I feared that if I were to catch any illness, it could potentially end my own life as well. But now, after her death, it almost felt like it didn't matter anymore. I was face to face with one hundred people, completely vulnerable.

The moment I felt that first tickle in my throat, I knew that I was in for a rough couple of days. The fever kicked in, ravaging my body on the first and second day. It was a fever unlike any other I had experienced before, leaving me weak and helpless.

One of my biggest fears has always been falling sick when I am alone. Stacie, being a nurse, had always been the one to take care of me during such times. She knew exactly what to do and how to make me feel better. But now, I had to face this illness on my own. It felt like a daunting task, one that I wasn't sure if I was prepared to handle.

It was even more challenging because, in the midst of my sickness, I couldn't locate my thermometer. It may seem like a small thing, but in that moment, it felt like a monumental setback. How could I monitor my fever and know when it was getting better if I couldn't even find a simple thermometer?

Nevertheless, with the help and support of my daughters, I managed to push through. They were there for me every step of the way, ensuring I had everything I needed and taking care of me in Stacie's absence. Their love and nurturing nature truly helped me overcome this ordeal.

Ultimately, after what seemed like an eternity, I began to recover. It wasn't an easy journey, but I made it through. This was the first major challenge that I had overcome since Stacie's passing, and it gave me a glimmer of hope. If I could conquer this, perhaps I could conquer the other challenges that lay ahead on my path of grief and healing.
