# Day 14: Pathway Toward Normal

Life has always had its ups and downs, its predictable moments and unexpected surprises. But nothing could have prepared
me for the devastating loss I experienced when my beloved wife lost her six-week battle with cancer. In that moment,
everything changed. My old life was gone, and I was left with the daunting task of rebuilding a new one.

Being a software engineer by profession, I have always been drawn to designing and crafting solutions. And so, it makes
sense to approach this new chapter in my life with the same mindset. I see myself as the architect designing all the
aspects of my new reality. This includes not only the practical aspects of rebuilding my career and personal life, but
also the emotional and psychological elements that are so essential for finding a sense of normalcy again.

Deep inside me, there has always been a storyteller, an author yearning to put words on paper. And now, as I embark on
this journey of grief and healing, I realize that one of the ways I can make sense of it all is by writing a new
story—one that encompasses the pain, the loss, and ultimately, the hope that I find along the way. My experiences,
thoughts, and emotions will pour onto the pages, capturing the rawness of my grief and the resilience that emerges as I
navigate this uncharted territory.

But my journey doesn't end with self-reflection and personal growth. As a teacher at heart, I am passionate about
helping others and guiding them through life's challenges. In this new phase of my life, I see myself as a teacher,
instructing others on how to move forward after experiencing such a profound loss. I believe that sharing my own story
can serve as a beacon of hope for those who may be lost in their own grief. While each person's journey is unique, the
lessons I learn and the insights I gain along the way may resonate with others and provide them with the strength and
inspiration to find their own pathway toward normal.

This is not a story I will write once all the pain has subsided and the wounds have healed. Instead, I write it in
real-time, as I live it, capturing the raw and unfiltered emotions that accompany grief. By sharing my experiences with
others, I hope to create a space where we can find solace, support, and understanding. Together, we can navigate this
difficult terrain and discover that there is indeed light at the end of the tunnel.

As a human being, I acknowledge that grief is an inevitable aspect of the human experience. It is a testament to the
love shared and the profound impact someone has had on our lives. And so, I will grieve. I will allow myself to feel the
immense pain and sorrow that comes with loss. Yet, alongside my grief, I will also find hope—a glimmer of light that
shines through the darkness, reminding me that there is another day waiting just beyond the horizon.

My story is just one among billions, yet through its telling, my hope is that it will resonate with others who are
grappling with their own grief. While our experiences may differ, the universal language of loss and resilience can
create a bridge that connects us all. Together, we can find our own pathway toward normal—a new normal that acknowledges
the pain of our past but opens us up to the possibilities of a future filled with hope and healing.
