# Day 47 - What is Integrity?

A ship is said to have integrity when all of the parts are working well together.  When it loses
integrity it will either sink to the bottom of the ocean or be stranded.

Dr. Henry Cloud defines integrity as a character that can meet the demands of reality.  Integrity
includes avoiding moral failure but goes far beyond that. It is about health and wholeness in every
aspect of life: emotional, mental, physical, moral, spiritual, and social.

As I navigate through life, I have come to understand that integrity is more than just avoiding
moral failure. It is about the harmonious working together of all aspects of my being - emotional,
mental, physical, moral, spiritual, and social. When I embody integrity, I am able to meet the
demands of reality and live a life of wholeness.


## The Importance of Maintaining Integrity

Losing integrity can have dire consequences, leading to self-destruction or a failure to reach one's
potential. To live out my destiny, I must ensure that all parts of my life are in sync and avoid
dysfunction. This involves being consistent in my actions, words, thoughts, and feelings, creating
a life of health and wholeness.


## Embracing My Strengths and Weaknesses

Each person possesses unique strengths that define them. For me, creative problem solving is at the
core of my identity, giving me qualities like focus, ambition, intelligence, and confidence.
However, this strength also carries a fatal flaw that can manifest as arrogance or hostility
towards others. Understanding and managing these strengths and weaknesses is crucial for
maintaining integrity.


## The Role of Relationships in Integrity

My wife, with her unparalleled generosity and caring nature, exemplified integrity in a different
way. She always put others before herself, sometimes to the detriment of her own well-being. Her
fatal flaw lay in neglecting her own needs in her quest to please and help others. Balancing our
strengths and weaknesses in the context of relationships is key to living a life of integrity.


## Striving for Wholeness and Health

Achieving integrity involves fully engaging with our strengths while minimizing the negative impacts
of our weaknesses. It is a delicate balancing act that requires self-awareness, introspection, and
a commitment to personal growth. Embracing both our strengths and weaknesses allows us to live
authentically and in alignment with our true selves.


## The Journey towards Integrity

Maintaining integrity is an ongoing journey that requires constant self-reflection and course
correction. It is about integrating all aspects of ourselves to create a life that is fulfilling,
purposeful, and in harmony with our true purpose. By embracing our strengths, acknowledging our
weaknesses, and striving for balance, we can live a life of integrity that leads us towards our
destiny.


## Conclusion

Embracing integrity is not a destination but a continuous process of growth and self-discovery. By
recognizing and managing our strengths and weaknesses, we can live a life that is whole, healthy,
and true to our authentic selves. In doing so, we pave the way towards fulfilling our destinies and
experiencing true fulfillment in life.
