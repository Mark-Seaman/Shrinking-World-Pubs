# Day 40 - Quest for Understanding

## Embracing Change

The next turning point in my life came around the age of 60. I sensed a shift approaching - a move away from striving
for others' goals towards a focus on my well-being and understanding the world around me. With financial stability from
our retirement investments, I no longer had a need to make money. This newfound freedom allowed me to explore my
interests and passions, leading me to a deeper understanding of life and the world.

Money was no longer the driving force; instead, it was about personal fulfillment and exploration. By the age of 55, I
stopped working for money and started working on projects that met others needs of my interests.  It was a liberating
shift that allowed me to pursue projects that aligned with my values and interests.  I no longer needed to march to
anyone else's drumbeat.  I could march to my own drumbeat.


## Financial Freedom

Creating a budget to sustain us until age 90 allowed us to live fully without worrying about running out of resources.
This financial security granted me the flexibility to choose projects based on passion rather than profit. My wife,
Stacie, shared this mindset, devoting her time to coaching, publishing, and mentoring. Together, we prioritized
experiences with our children and grandchildren, enriching our lives with family connections.

None of these new career opportunities ever came close to breaking even and would never have been possible without the
financial security we had achieved.  We were able to live our lives without worrying about money.  We were able to focus
on our passions and our family.

Our three kids were all approaching middle age and had families of their own.  We were able to spend time with them and
assist them in their lives.  We were able to travel and see the world.  We were able to spend time with our
grandchildren and watch them grow up.  I am so grateful for the time we all had together. I am somewhat surprise by how close our family has remained as the kids have become adults.


## Coping with Loss

Tragically, Stacie's passing forced me to navigate life without my partner. As I continue to support our family through
this challenging time, I've found solace in immersing myself in writing. Writing has become my core activity, whether
crafting new ideas or revisiting past work. Venturing into the realm of artificial intelligence, I've embraced its
potential for teaching, writing, and software development. This newfound creativity marks a pinnacle in my career, born
from personal growth spurred by adversity.

Stacie's death propelled me into a deeper introspection, reigniting a thirst for learning and understanding. Despite the
inevitable challenges ahead, I remain optimistic about what the future holds. Reflecting on my journey, I draw strength
from the resilience I've shown in overcoming past obstacles. Each day is a chance to grow, inspire, and make a positive
impact on the world.


## A Quest Unfolds

This period of my life symbolizes a quest for self-discovery and enlightenment. As I navigate the complexities of
existence, I find fulfillment in unraveling the mysteries of the world. Embracing change has allowed me to embrace a
holistic approach to life, one rooted in well-being and understanding. The journey continues, with each day offering new
opportunities for growth, creativity, and connection.

As I set forth into the unknown, I carry with me the lessons learned from a life well-lived. Challenges may arise, but I
face them with courage and determination, knowing that each obstacle is an opportunity for growth. Through writing, AI
exploration, and personal reflection, I forge ahead on a path of discovery, embracing the evolving landscape of my
existence.

Looking towards the horizon, I see a future brimming with possibilities. The road ahead may twist and turn, but I walk
it with conviction and optimism. With the wisdom gained from past experiences and the resilience cultivated through
adversity, I step boldly into the next chapter of my life, ready to seize every moment and savor the journey that lies
ahead.

I am so grateful for Stacie's influence in my life.  In many ways she taught me how to live and love well.
This has allowed me to live a life of purpose and meaning and live a life of destiny.
