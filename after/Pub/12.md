## Day 12: Survive Today - Thrive Tomorrow

Trauma has a way of ripping apart our lives, leaving no room for margin or respite. It demands more from us than we can
possibly give. In the aftermath of such devastation, our focus shifts from envisioning a future to simply trying to make
it through each day. The lens through which we view our lives is forever altered, and the concept of a "good life"
becomes distant and intangible. In this new reality, survival becomes our sole priority, and self-care becomes not just
important, but critical.

When we experience trauma, whether it be the loss of a loved one, a severe accident, or any other deeply distressing
event, our lives are turned upside down. Suddenly, everything we once knew is shattered, and we are left to pick up the
pieces and somehow find a way forward. It is during this time that we must let go of any expectations of what our future
should look like. Instead, we must focus on the present moment, or even the next hour, and dedicate our energy towards
simply enduring.

In these moments of survival, it is crucial to remember that we can only spend the margin we have. We cannot pour from
an empty cup, and attempting to do so will only lead to further exhaustion and burnout. It is essential to prioritize
self-care, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. Taking moments for ourselves to rest, recharge, and engage in
activities that bring us some semblance of peace can make all the difference in our ability to keep going.

While it may feel like an insurmountable task at times, it is important to remember that this state of mere survival is
not forever. Although the road to thriving may seem distant and unattainable now, it is not out of reach. As we
gradually heal and work through our trauma, we will begin to regain our strength and rediscover our ability to thrive.
But for now, our focus must remain on surviving, on taking each day as it comes, and on doing whatever it takes to make
it through this journey.

Life after trauma is a long and complex process. It requires patience, resilience, and a willingness to adapt to this
new reality. Though it may seem daunting, there is hope. By prioritizing our survival today and embracing self-care, we
lay the foundations for a brighter future. Each day that we endure brings us one step closer to thriving once again. So
let us hold on, let us strive to make it through today, and trust that tomorrow will bring new possibilities for growth,
healing, and ultimate triumph.
