# Day 85 - My New Life

In this new chapter of my life, I am focused on four key areas: behavior, relationships, beliefs,
and emotions. I have learned that what I do, say, think, and feel all play a crucial role in
shaping my reality. By consciously aligning these aspects of myself with my highest good, I have
been able to create a life that is fulfilling and abundant.

To thrive in this new life, I have made a commitment to personal growth and self-awareness. This
involves a constant process of transformation, reflection, learning, and adaptation, as I seek to
become the best version of myself. This transformation touches every aspect of my being.

I practice these rules to prevent dysfunction and disaster.  When I violate these I do it at my own
peril.  I have scars to prove it.


## Developing Guidelines

### Behavior - What I do

I have made a conscious effort to act with integrity and compassion in all that I do. By aligning my
actions with my values and goals, I have been able to make a positive impact on those around me and
create a sense of purpose in my daily life.  The greatest improvement will be a lack of striving 
to prove myself.  I will accept reality as it is and be grateful for whatever comes.

### Relationships - What I say

I have prioritized open and honest communication in my relationships, seeking to foster trust and
understanding with those I care about. By speaking from the heart and listening with empathy, I
have been able to cultivate deeper connections and create a supportive network of loved ones.

### Beliefs - What I think

I have worked to challenge and reshape limiting beliefs that once held me back, replacing them with
thoughts of abundance and possibility. By shifting my mindset towards optimism and growth, I have
been able to attract new opportunities and experiences into my life.

### Emotions - What I feel

I have embraced my emotions as valuable messengers, allowing myself to feel and express them
authentically. By honoring my feelings and learning from them, I have been able to cultivate
emotional intelligence and resilience in the face of life's challenges.


## Transformation

This week has been the most transformative experience of my entire life.   I truly feel the impact
of moving from life to death and back again.  My journey is far from complete but I have had the
fundamental breakthrough that I have been longing for over the past 90 days.  I am now poised to
begin the restoration and healing.  I am alive again!

In embracing this new way of living, I have found a sense of peace and fulfillment that I never
thought possible. My journey from death to new life has been transformative, teaching me valuable
lessons about resilience, faith, and the power of personal growth. As I continue to walk this path,
I look forward to the adventures and blessings that await me, knowing that I am now living my best
life.
