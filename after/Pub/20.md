# Day 20: Join the Adventure

As my exciting journey approaches, I can't help but feel a surge of exhilaration and anticipation.
With just a few weeks left until departure, I am eagerly counting down the days. This adventure
will take me from the sunny shores of Florida all the way to the stunning city of Amsterdam, where
I will be joined by my dear children Josiah and Rachel. Together, we will embark on an incredible
expedition through several European countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia,
and Germany.

The itinerary for this trip is truly breathtaking. I've provided details in the article, 
[Exploring the World](https://seamansguide.com/journey/Cruise.md).  The cost is amazingly cheap
considering that all of the food, lodging, and transportation is all bundled together.

Each day will bring us to a new port, allowing us
to experience the vibrant cultures and unique landscapes of these magnificent destinations. And the
best part is, we won't have to worry about finding accommodation each night - our hotel will come
with us as we journey from place to place. It's a truly hassle-free way to explore the world and
soak in the beauty of these incredible locations.

Since I made the decision to embark on this incredible adventure, I have been filled with a desire
to share this experience with others. The thought of having two of my kids by my side, creating lasting
memories together, brings even more excitement to my heart.

If you're interested in joining us, I highly recommend checking out the article I wrote about this
incredible journey. In it, I provide a detailed itinerary and the associated costs for the trip.
It's a great way to get a sense of what this adventure entails and whether it aligns with your
interests and budget.

Exploring the world is an opportunity like no other. It allows us to see new places, meet new
people, and immerse ourselves in different cultures. The memories we create along the way are
priceless, and the friendships we forge will last a lifetime.

So, if you're up for an adventure of a lifetime, don't hesitate - join me on this incredible journey
across Europe. Let's make memories that will be cherished forever, as we explore the breathtaking
beauty of these incredible countries. Together, we will embark on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure,
filled with laughter, discovery, and lifelong friendships. The world is waiting - are you ready to
join the adventure?

If you are feeling overwhelmed with life, then you may need some time away to ponder what it is
all about.  I would love the company.
