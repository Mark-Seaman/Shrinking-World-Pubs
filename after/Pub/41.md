# Day 41 - Measuring Success 

Success is a concept that evolves with us, shifting its parameters as we move through different
stages of life. Success is a multifaceted and deeply personal concept that changes as we move
through life's stages. From seeking love and independence in youth to building careers and families
in adulthood, accumulating wealth and influence in middle age, and focusing on well-being and
health in old age, the measures of success reflect our shifting priorities and values.
Understanding these transitions can help us appreciate the diverse forms of success and encourage a
more compassionate and nuanced view of achievement at any age.


## Belonging and Love

In youth, the concept of success is often tied to two primary feelings: belonging and love, and
getting one's way. At this formative stage, success can be measured by the strength of
relationships with family and friends, indicating a sense of belonging and being loved.
Achievements in school, sports, or hobbies, while important, are often seen through the lens of
gaining approval and establishing a place within social circles.

Getting one's way, on the other hand, reflects a child's growing independence and ability to
influence their environment. Success here is measured by the ability to assert oneself, make
choices, and have those choices respected by peers and adults alike. It's a delicate balance
between autonomy and cooperation, where success is found in the ability to navigate personal
desires within the framework of communal harmony.


## Building and Balancing

As we enter adulthood, the markers of success become more externally defined, focusing on career and
family. Career success is often measured by professional achievements, such as promotions, salary
increases, and recognition in one's field. It's about building a reputation, contributing to the
field, and finding fulfillment through work.

Family success, conversely, is measured by the health and happiness of one's family life. Success in
this area can mean establishing a supportive and loving partnership, raising well-adjusted
children, and maintaining strong family bonds. It's about creating a nurturing home environment
where every member feels valued and supported.


## Accumulation and Influence

In middle age, the focus of success often shifts towards wealth and power. Success in wealth is not
merely about the accumulation of material resources but also financial security and the ability to
provide for one's family and plan for the future. It reflects a stage where the fruits of one's
labor in career and investments come to bear significant outcomes.

Power, or influence, is another measure of success at this stage. It's about having a say in the
larger conversation, whether in one's professional field, community, or broader societal issues.
Success is seen in the ability to impact decisions, lead initiatives, and contribute to the shaping
of environments beyond the personal sphere.


## Reflection and Contentment

In old age, the measures of success become introspective, focusing on well-being and health. Success
in well-being is about achieving a state of contentment, where life is filled with meaningful
relationships, activities, and a sense of peace with one's past and present. It's the culmination
of a life's journey, reflecting on and enjoying the legacy one has built.

Health as a measure of success emphasizes the importance of physical and mental wellness.
Maintaining one's health to enjoy life fully, engage with loved ones, and pursue interests becomes
a priority. Success here is about the quality of life, managing chronic conditions effectively, and
retaining independence for as long as possible.
