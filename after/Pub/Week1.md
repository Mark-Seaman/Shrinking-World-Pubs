# Rebuilding After Loss

## [Day 1: Embracing Life After Death](01.md)

After losing my beloved wife to cancer, I am left questioning if there is life after death. I cannot fully grasp the
fact that she is gone. Our entire life together revolved around each other, and now that she is no longer here, my world
has come crashing down.  As a writer, I find solace in putting my emotions into words, using reason to navigate the
chaos in my mind. I believe in finding a new life and intend to document my journey of rebuilding through writing. If
you're interested, you can follow my story at [seamanfamily.org/after](https://seamanfamily.org/after) as I experience
it. I hope to provide guidance and solace in the face of devastating loss.


## [Day 2: Illness Challenge](02.md)

It was inevitable that I would get sick at some point. With illnesses like COVID-19 and influenza lurking around, I knew
it was only a matter of time. But it hit me right off the bat when I was just beginning to think about rebuilding.
Facing illness alone was a challenging journey, but it gave me a glimmer of hope. If I could overcome this illness,
maybe I could conquer the other challenges that grief and healing had in store for me.


## [Day 3: Where is the Joy?](03.md)

I have noticed that not all activities bring me joy. Some tasks drain my soul, and I actively avoid them whenever
possible. On the other hand, there are activities that bring me immense joy. I believe this is true for everyone, though
the specific activities may differ since we are all unique individuals. As I seek to build a new life, I need to prune
everything and prioritize what "sparks joy." This is the primary goal for day three. Understanding what brings me joy
will help me navigate the challenges ahead.


## [Day 4: Focus on Self-Care](04.md) 

Focus on Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping.  Today I began to look at trying to life a healthy life.  I have been
struggling with eating, drinking, and sleeping.  I have been trying to eat, but I have not been eating well.  My lifestyle
over the last few months has degraded and is not sustainable.  I consciously think about drinking water to stay hydrated. 
Eating is difficult and I am rarely hungry and sleeping is a memory from my former life.  I need to rebuild personal habits
that can support a healthy life.


## Day 5: No Big Decisions

By the fifth day, I realized that making significant decisions was not something I was ready for. The fog of grief made it impossible to think clearly, and I felt paralyzed by the weight of choices before me. I decided to give myself time, allowing the grief to settle and my mind to find some clarity. The pressure to make drastic decisions could wait until a later time when I was more equipped to handle them.

## Day 6: Christmas Blues

As the holiday season approached, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of sorrow. The festive cheer around me contrasted starkly with the emptiness I felt inside. Memories of past celebrations flooded my mind, and I longed for the comfort of your presence. The holiday season served as a bittersweet reminder of the joy we once shared and the void that now existed.

## Day 7: The Guest Book

On the seventh day, I discovered the power of the guest book. Friends, family, and even acquaintances poured their love and condolences into heartfelt messages. Reading their words reminded me that I was not alone in my pain and that there was a vast network of support surrounding me. The guest book became a tangible source of comfort, providing solace in the days ahead.

Throughout this first week, grief consumed my every thought and emotion. Each day brought a new challenge, a new wave of emotions to navigate. But amidst the pain, I began to recognize the strength within me to face these challenges head-on. And while life after loss seemed uncertain and daunting, I vowed to take it one day at a time, honoring your memory and finding my own path forward.
