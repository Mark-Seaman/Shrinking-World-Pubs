# Rebuilding After Loss

## [Day 1: Embracing Life After Death](01.md)

After losing my beloved wife to cancer, I am left questioning if there is life after death. I cannot fully grasp the
fact that she is gone. Our entire life together revolved around each other, and now that she is no longer here, my world
has come crashing down.  As a writer, I find solace in putting my emotions into words, using reason to navigate the
chaos in my mind. I believe in finding a new life and intend to document my journey of rebuilding through writing. If
you're interested, you can follow my story at [seamanfamily.org/after](https://seamanfamily.org/after) as I experience
it. I hope to provide guidance and solace in the face of devastating loss.


## [Day 2: Illness Challenge](02.md)

It was inevitable that I would get sick at some point. With illnesses like COVID-19 and influenza lurking around, I knew
it was only a matter of time. But it hit me right off the bat when I was just beginning to think about rebuilding.
Facing illness alone was a challenging journey, but it gave me a glimmer of hope. If I could overcome this illness,
maybe I could conquer the other challenges that grief and healing had in store for me.


## [Day 3: Where is the Joy?](03.md)

I have noticed that not all activities bring me joy. Some tasks drain my soul, and I actively avoid them whenever
possible. On the other hand, there are activities that bring me immense joy. I believe this is true for everyone, though
the specific activities may differ since we are all unique individuals. As I seek to build a new life, I need to prune
everything and prioritize what "sparks joy." This is the primary goal for day three. Understanding what brings me joy
will help me navigate the challenges ahead.


## [Day 4: Focus on Self-Care](04.md) 

Focus on Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping.  Today I began to look at trying to life a healthy life.  I have been
struggling with eating, drinking, and sleeping.  I have been trying to eat, but I have not been eating well.  My lifestyle
over the last few months has degraded and is not sustainable.  I consciously think about drinking water to stay hydrated. 
Eating is difficult and I am rarely hungry and sleeping is a memory from my former life.  I need to rebuild personal habits
that can support a healthy life.


## [Day 5: Making Decisions](05.md)

Stacie and I always made decisions together. I make decisions quickly, and she was more deliberate.  I am now faced with
having to make hundreds of decisions on my own.  I am learning to slow down and think about the consequences but this is not
easy.  Therefore, I am learning to seek advice from others and trust their input.  Fortunately, I have a network of trusted
individuals who can give good counsel to take part of the role that Stacie played in my life.  I will not make any major 
decisions without consulting with them.


## [Day 6: Christmas Blues](06.md)

Stacie always loved Christmas. For her it was a time of joy and celebration.  She loved the special time to be with
family and friends. This was a year without Christmas.  Some people from church came over to put up lights on our house a
few days before Stacie's death.  Some neighbors drove me to get a Christmas tree and our kids all got together to decorate it.
People were so kind and thoughtful.  I was not in the mood for Christmas.  I did not want to celebrate but I made it through.
Now each holiday will present a similar challenge.  I will need to find a way to celebrate without Stacie.


## [Day 7: The Guest Book](07.md)

It's been a week since Stacie's memorial service.  At the memorial we had a guest book to collect contact info
for people that attended.  This allows me have ongoing communication with people that were there.  Many of the people
that attended the service I had not seen for a decade or more.   What a wonderful blessing it is to be in contact once
again. I am so grateful for the people that came to the service or watched online and for the opportunity to reconnect with them.
