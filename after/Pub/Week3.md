# Chapter 3: Repositioning


## [Day 15: Taking a Step towards Freedom](/after/15.md)                        

Throughout 2023 Stacie and I work an insane number of hours.  We found ourselves completely overcommitted and felt
unable to renegotiate.  As a consequence we canceled three family vacations that we had planned.
By October we agreed to retire.


## [Day 16: Retiring For Real](/after/16.md)                                     

This year I found myself trying to balance three full-time careers, and working 60 hours/week all year.  I was killing
myself and dragging Stacie along with me.  We decided that when classes were done in December that I would retire and
take on a much slower lifestyle.  We would no longer allow ourselves to be trapped in a cycle of overcommitment.


## [Day 17: Ocean Cruise](/after/17.md)                                          

To mark this change in attitude we booked an ocean cruise.  It would be a month long, which was longer than any vacation
we had ever taken in our lives.  Never had we allowed ourselves to be off the clock for so long.  It was an extravagant
way to mark our new life together. But it was not to be.


## [Day 18: Writing at Sea](/after/18.md)                                        

In the days at sea I was intending to finish my autobiography that I have been working on for several years.  Stacie has
helped others write and publish their life story, and I was also going to help Stacie write her story.  But time ran out for
both of us.


## [Day 19: Loss Redeemed](/after/19.md)                                         

Several weeks after Stacie died, my daughter Rachel approached me.  She asked me how I would feel about going on the
trip with her.  This changed everything for me.   No longer would this be a trip of despair and loneliness, but one of
new beginning. 
Now,  my son Josiah will also be joining us on the cruise.  Both of them have kids and jobs that prevent them from being
gone for a whole month. But the trip itinerary makes it easy for them to tour Scandinavia with me.  


## [Day 20: Join the Adventure](/after/20.md)                                    

The first  two weeks will be the solo voyage from Florida to Amsterdam.  Josiah and Rachel will join me in Amsterdam,
and we will go together to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Germany.  Each day is a new port and the hotel
moves at night.
Now that I am going, I am hoping to invite some friends with me.  Check out this article I wrote shortly after we booked the trip.

It shows the itinerary and cost for the trip in case you might be interested in
joining me.


## [Day 21: Surrounded by Love](/after/21.md)                                    

I am so grateful to have my kids with me on this trip.  I am also grateful for the many friends who have reached out to
me in my time of need.  I am surrounded by love and support.  I am not alone. So many people have poured out their kindness 
and generosity to me.  I am truly blessed.  I am also humbled by to be the recipient of so much love.
