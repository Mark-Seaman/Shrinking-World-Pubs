# Chapter 9 - A New Measure of Success

## [End of Striving](/after/57.md) 

One of the most important aspects of my new life is the end of striving. I used to believe that the key to happiness lay
in achieving more success and more recognition. I constantly compared myself to others, measuring my worth by their
standards. This is a path to misery. But the more I chased after external validation, the more I
realized that it only left me feeling empty and unsatisfied.


## [A Better Way to Live](/after/58.md)

Throughout my life, I've always been a go-getter, constantly striving to achieve more and do more. However, I've come to
the place where I want less.  It is time to simplify my life.  I have accomplished all I need and more will not be better.


## [Unrealistic Expectations](/after/59.md)

The souce of much of my striving was unrealistic expectations.  These were occasionally put on me by others but more often
they were self-imposed.  I have learned to let go of perfectionism and embrace life as it is rather than as I wish it to be.
This has been a difficult lifelong journey for me but I am finally making progress.


## [Replacing Goals With Priorities](/after/60.md)

I have learned to replace goals with priorities.  I now am giving careful thought to how I spend my time and what projects and
people get my attention.  On the other hand, I have released expectations of what I should achieve.


## [Seeking Fulfillment](/after/61.md)

I have a much more holistic view of what it means to be fulfilled.  It is not just about success in my career or personal life.
It is about finding balance and meaning in all aspects of my life.  


## [Thrive With Healthy Habits](/after/62.md)

What I do occassionally is not as important as what I do every day.  I have learned to focus on healthy habits that will sustain
a lifestyle that is fulfilling and meaningful.  I am giving special consideration to my emotional well-being.


## [A Life With Integrity](/after/63.md)

Integrity only happens when everything works together.  The opposite of integrity is disintegration.  When a ship loses
integrity it will eventually sink.  I have learned to align my actions with my values and to live a life that works.
