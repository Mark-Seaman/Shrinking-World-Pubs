# Day 32 - Friends and Family

I measure my connections with friends and family in hours. For me, deep conversation and building trust can never be
rushed or accomplished in a matter of minutes. It requires investing hours of quality time, where we can delve into each
other's hopes, fears, and dreams. These are not discussions that can be limited to surface-level interactions or the
belonging to the same group. Instead, true connection is an investment that accumulates over the span of decades, as we
navigate life together.

In a world filled with shallow interactions and superficial connections, I seek solace in genuine and authentic
relationships. I find it hard to engage in large groups, where small talk reigns supreme. Instead, I prefer seeking out
intimate and private interactions, where we can truly connect without distractions. Ideally, we would sit down and share
a meal, breaking bread together as we share our innermost thoughts and emotions.

Forming these meaningful connections requires intentionality and effort on my part. I have learned to schedule
encounters daily, making time for those who truly matter in my life. But it doesn't end there. I also actively seek out
spontaneous encounters, cherishing those unexpected moments of connection that often turn out to be the most precious. I
invest my energy into these relationships, knowing that the more I put in, the more I will receive in return.

Living in the moment has been a valuable lesson on my journey towards deep and meaningful connections. I used to be
caught up in the past, dwelling on missed opportunities or attempting to influence and control others. But now, I
consciously lay down my expectations of others. My desire is not to control or manipulate, but rather to genuinely
connect. I gauge my involvement in the lives of others based on their own desire to connect with me. I have come to
realize that I cannot force a connection, but I can foster an environment where true friendship and heartfelt bonds can
flourish.

We often emphasize quantity over quality ... I choose to value the depth of my relationships rather than the
number of connections I have. It is through investing my time and energy, sharing the highs and lows of life, and
opening up my heart that I have found true companionship. Friends and family are my lifeline, the constant support and
love that guide me through the journey of life. And for these connections, I will forever be grateful.
