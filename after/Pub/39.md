# Day 39 - The Quest for Purpose


## The Pursuit of Success

In my 20s and 30s, I was focused on building a career and raising a family. Living on a tight budget meant financial
stress was a constant companion. Despite a good job, there was always more month left at the end of the money. Our
financial priorities revolved around providing for our kids.

At 23, we began saving 10% of our income for retirement. By the time I was 45, we had saved enough to stop saving for
retiring. We were not able to live off of our retirement but not longer needed to contribute toward it.  We felt that
the investments we had would allow us to retire someday as long as we made enough to cover our living expenses.

As financial burdens eased, a new question arose in my mind - what did I want to do with my life beyond
success?  I began to seek a greater purpose and my attention shifted from career success to personal fulfillment and significance.


## Seeking a Greater Purpose

Midway through my 40s, the desire for significance overshadowed my quest for success. I delved into serving the
community, investing in our family, and helping our kids discover their unique strengths and destinies. Beyond following
rules, I sought to instill in them a sense of identity that would guide them throughout life.

Despite climbing the ladder at work and reaching a leadership position, I felt dissatisfied. The book 'Halftime'
inspired me to consider transitioning from pursuing success to seeking significance. However, figuring out the next
chapter of my life took time, and I knew change was on the horizon.

I contemplated the legacy I wanted to leave behind and the impact I desired to make. I sought out a life of ministry 
instead of the corporate world.  I wanted to make a difference in the world and not just make a living.  I found little
opportunity in the non-profit world and found that there was no real opportunity to use my skills and experience or my
strengths.  I pursued the few opportunities that I found but contunued to do engineering work.


## Shift in Focus

In my 40s and 50s, my main goal was to support our kids in establishing their lives. As our family engaged in church
activities and missions, the focus shifted from personal success to making a difference in the world. Stagnation in my
career led to a series of transitions between various roles, seeking fulfillment beyond mere accomplishments.

I left my job at HP to start a software company.  I wrote several textbooks and taught at a University of Northern
Colorado. Each of these roles provided a new perspective and contributed to a sense of fulfillment and purpose, but I
continued to seek a more significant impact.

Success was equated with tangible achievements, leading me to become overly focused on performance. This mindset
eventually took a toll on my mental health as I realized the futility of running endlessly on the hamster wheel of life.
The need for a shift in perspective became evident as I entered a new phase of life.


## Embracing Change

The journey from success to significance was not linear, but a series of twists and turns that guided me towards a
deeper understanding of my purpose. Transitioning from a career-focused mindset to one centered on making an impact
required introspection, resilience, and a willingness to embrace change.

As I navigated the challenges of midlife, I discovered that true fulfillment came from aligning my actions with my
values and passions. Embracing new opportunities and redefining success on my own terms allowed me to embrace life's
uncertainties with a sense of purpose and contentment.

As I approached 60, I found myself at a another crossroads, ready to embark on a new quest. The pursuit of significance
had run its course, and I was eager to explore the next chapter of my life. The quest for understanding was about to
begin.  My passion for making a difference in the world was still strong, but I was now eager to understand life at a
deeper level.  Fulfillment could no longer be found in serving others, but in understanding the world and my place in it.
