# Week 2: Relationships

## [Day 8: Meaningful Relationships](08.md)

It's been two weeks since Stacie's passing. I've been reflecting on the importance of relationships in my life. I've
always been a social person, but I never realized how much I relied on my wife for emotional support until she was gone.
I've been trying to reach out to friends and family more often, but it's not the same as having someone who knows you
inside and out.


## [Day 9: Grief Isolates and Connects](09.md)

Grief is a profound experience that each and every one of us will face at some point in our lives. It is a universal
truth, yet it remains a topic we rarely discuss openly. I've been grappling with how to best process my own grief 
in relationship to others. I've found that grief isolates and connects us in ways we never expected.


## [Day 10: My Social Director](10.md)

Stacie was my social director. She managed our social life.   She was gifted at building and nurturing relationships.
But now that she's gone, I must learn to do what she did so naturally. This requires learning new skills and practices.


## [Day 11: Group Gatherings](11.md)

Some prefer to meet in large groups, but I prefer smaller gatherings. I find it easier to connect with others when there
are fewer people around. I've been trying to find ways to make group gatherings more meaningful for me. During the 
time of rebuilding my new life, I am trying to be more intentional about my social interactions.


## [Day 12: Survive Today - Thrive Tomorrow](12.md)

Taking one day at a time is a common mantra for those who are grieving. It is necessary to focus on the very small things
when all of the big things are overwhelming.  There is no way to know what tomorrow will bring, so it's best to focus on 
today or even the next hour.


## [Day 13: Meaningful Daily Habits](13.md)

My new life requires new habits. I am trying to be more intentional about my daily activities. I want to make sure that
I am doing things that bring me joy and fulfillment. I am trying to be more present in the moment and pay attention to
how I feel. Eventually, these new habits will become second nature. But for now, I must be intentional about each one.


## [Day 14: Pathway Toward Normal](14.md)

I am trying to find a new normal. I am trying to use all my strengths as a Writer, Teacher, and Software Developer
to rebuild my life after the loss of my wife. Each of these creative mindsets has a role to play in my journey towards
health and healing.
