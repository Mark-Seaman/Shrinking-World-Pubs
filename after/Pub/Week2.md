# Week 2: Relationships

## [Day 8: The Importance of Relationships](08.md)

It's been two weeks since Stacie's passing. I've been reflecting on the importance of relationships in my life. I've
always been a social person, but I never realized how much I relied on my wife for emotional support until she was gone.
I've been trying to reach out to friends and family more often, but it's not the same as having someone who knows you
inside and out.
