# Week 7 - Celebrating Our Life Together

## [Facing Necessary Endings](/after/43.md)      

Change is inevitable in life. Whether we choose it or it is thrust upon us, transitions are always accompanied by pain.
We must navigate through the process of ending something in order to make room for a new beginning. Even though endings
can be difficult, they are necessary for growth and progress.

Stacie's final tour was a celebration of her life and the impact she had on the world. It was a time to honor her memory
and the legacy she left behind. The tour was a beautiful tribute to her life and the love she shared with others.

Valentine's Day was a day of reflection and remembrance. It was a time to honor the love Stacie and I shared and to
celebrate the incredible journey we had together. As I reflect on this Valentine's Day, I am reminded of the profound
love we had and the impact it had on my life.
