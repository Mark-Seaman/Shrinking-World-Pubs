# Day 17: Ocean Cruise

To mark our retirement we booked a trip of a lifetime.

We were determined to mark this change in our lives with an extravagant ocean cruise. It would be a
month long, which was longer than any vacation we had ever taken in our lives.  Never had we
allowed ourselves to be off the clock for so long.  It was an glorious way to start our new life
together.

As we made the reservations for the month-long cruise, excitement bloomed within us. Never in our
lives had we allowed ourselves to be off the clock for such an extended period of time. It was an
opportunity to indulge in relaxation, exploration, and the joy of being together. The thought of
visiting eight new countries, ones we had never been to before, filled us with a sense of adventure
and anticipation. 

In October we booked tickets on a repositioning cruise, where the ships move from Gulf of Mexico to
the Baltic Sea.  The trip was scheduled for May when the weather is nice.  This would give us months 
after school was done to plan and dream and do the research on Scandinavia.  We had never been there
before and this kind of a cruise had been a dream of ours for many years.

However, our dreams were shattered when Stacie fell ill just a week after making the reservations.
As the weeks passed, her condition worsened, and our hopes of embarking on that voyage together
faded away. Stacie's battle with her illness was brief but fierce, and a few weeks later, she left
this world, leaving me with memories far too painful to bear. 

Every time I think of that ocean cruise, it brings tears streaming down my face. It serves as a
bittersweet reminder of the many other incredible trips we had taken together, exploring different
corners of the world. But this particular trip was meant to be the beginning of a new chapter in
our lives, filled with adventure, love, and boundless possibilities. 

I look back now and realize how ironically cruel life can be. Just when we thought we had found the
freedom to embrace a new way of living, fate intervened and snatched it away from us. The trip that
was meant to represent our new life became a symbol of loss and missed opportunities. It became a
stark reminder of the fragility and unpredictability of life. 

Grief is a journey that never truly ends. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, and just when you think
you've reached the peak, another wave crashes into you, pushing you down. But I have come to accept
that grief is also a testament to the love we shared. It is a reflection of the depth of our
connection and the impact Stacie had on my life. It is a reminder that even though she is no longer
physically by my side, her spirit lives on within me. 

So, as I sit here, reminiscing about the ocean cruise we never got to take, I choose to focus on the
joy we once shared and the love that will forever be etched in my heart. I hold onto the memories
of our incredible adventures together and the anticipation we felt for the trip that never was.
Though our journey together was cut short, I am grateful for the time we had and the memories we
created. 

Life may have dealt us a cruel hand, but as I navigate this new reality, I am determined to honor
Stacie's memory by continuing to live a life filled with love, adventure, and the pursuit of
capturing every precious moment. Our ocean cruise may have been interrupted, but the spirit of that
journey will forever be a part of who I am.
