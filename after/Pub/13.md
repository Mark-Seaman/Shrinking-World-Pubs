# Day 13: Meaningful Daily Habits

As humans, our daily activities often become ingrained habits that shape our identity, provide us with comfort, and
offer a sense of security. However, when a significant person in our lives is no longer present, these habits can lose
their meaning. This has been my experience since Stacie, my beloved partner, passed away. Suddenly, the routines and
habits that were once second nature to me feel empty and pointless. In my journey to rebuild my life, I have come to
realize that forging new habits is essential.

The process of finding a new normal is not an easy one. It is fraught with emotional landmines as we confront the grief
and loss of our loved ones. It requires us to strip away decades of automatic responses and reprogram our daily lives.
This task may seem overwhelming at first, but it is a necessary step towards healing and moving forward.

To begin this process, I have dedicated the next few weeks to carefully consider what I want my daily activities to look
like. I recognize that these activities should align with my values and reflect who I aspire to be in the future. By
consciously choosing each practice, I hope to create a new routine that brings fulfillment and purpose to my life.

Once I have determined my priorities, I will commit to devoting my time and energy to these practices. It is only
through intentional effort and dedication that I can establish new habits that will sustain me in this new chapter of my
life. Although it may take some time - studies have shown that it typically takes at least 30 iterations for habits to
truly form.

The process of forming new habits is not merely about going through the motions; it is about finding meaning and purpose
in each activity. This will require me to be present in the moment, to pay attention to the sensations and emotions that
arise, and to consciously choose how I react. By doing so, I believe that I can rebuild a sense of control and agency in
my life.

In the months ahead, I will embark on this journey of habit formation. With each day, I will take small steps towards
creating a new normalâ€”a life that is filled with intention and purpose. While the path may be challenging, I am hopeful
that by forging new habits, I will not only find solace but also rediscover joy and meaning in the simplest of daily
activities.
