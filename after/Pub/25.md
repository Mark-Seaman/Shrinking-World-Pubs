# Day 25 - Traffic Pattern

As I navigate through different rooms of my new life, it's important for me to establish a healthy
traffic pattern. This pattern is not just about the "what" but also the "how" of how I interact
with myself and others. 

Beyond just going through the motions, I need to shift my focus to being present and intentional
with my actions. The process matters as much as the outcome. It's crucial for me to be fully
engaged in whatever I am doing, whether it's work, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones. This
way, I can truly experience the joy and fulfillment that comes from being fully present in the
moment.

In addition to the "what," the "how" of rebuilding my life is equally important. I need to be
authentic, genuine, and true to myself. Honoring my own values and principles is key to creating a
life that feels meaningful and aligned with who I am at my core. It's important for me to embrace
my strengths and vulnerabilities, and to show up as my true self in all aspects of my life.

Creating my own rules for how I want to live and interact with the world is empowering. It allows me
to take charge of my own happiness and well-being. Some suggestions for my own rules include:

1. **Be authentic** - I will show up as my true self, embracing all my strengths and vulnerabilities.
This authenticity will not only help me connect with others on a deeper level, but also allow me to
be more accepting and compassionate towards myself.

2. **Embrace brokenness** - I will understand that I don't need to be perfect. Healing comes from
accepting and embracing my brokenness, and recognizing that these experiences shape who I am.
Instead of hiding my wounds, I will use them as a source of strength and growth.

3. **I control me** - While I can't control others, I have the power to control my own actions and
reactions. I will take responsibility for my own emotions and choices, and not let external
circumstances dictate how I feel or behave. I will also not take responsibility over how others
behave, interact, or what they think or feel.  If I am not responsible then I will seek to accept
the reality as it is.

4. **Live in the moment** - Rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, I will focus
on the present. Life happens in the present moment, and by being fully present, I can fully
experience and enjoy the richness of each moment.

5. **Meaningful conversations over group involvement** - I will prioritize deep and meaningful
connections over superficial engagements. Instead of spreading myself thin by engaging in numerous
social activities, I will invest my time and energy in cultivating authentic relationships that
bring love and support into my life.

6. **Full engagement or avoidance** - I will be fully present and engaged in activities that bring me
joy, passion, and a sense of purpose. I will also be aware when it's time to step away and take
care of myself. It's important to acknowledge when I need rest or when certain activities no longer
serve me, and to honor those needs without guilt.

Establishing a healthy traffic pattern in my new life will create a strong foundation for my journey
of healing and rebuilding. By being intentional and authentic in my actions, and by setting my own
rules for how I want to live and interact with the world, I can create a life that is meaningful
and aligned with my true self.
