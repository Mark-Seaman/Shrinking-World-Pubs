# Day 19: Loss Redeemed

Losing Stacie was truly devastating. Not only did I lose my best friend and lover, I lost my hopes
and dreams for the life we expected together.  The cruise that we had planned for May was destroyed
by her death in December. I had no desire to travel without her but hadn't canceled the tickets
yet.

It was a few weeks after Stacie's death when my daughter Rachel approached me with an idea that
would forever alter the course of our grieving process. She asked me how I would feel about going
on the trip with her. At first, I couldn't comprehend what she meant. How could a trip possibly help
us heal from the immense loss we had experienced? But then she explained her reasoning.

Rachel believed that this trip could be a turning point for both of us. It could serve as a way for
us to confront our grief head-on and lean on each other as we embarked on a journey of rebuilding
our lives without Stacie. Instead of drowning in sorrow, this trip had the potential to be a
journey of new beginnings and rediscovery.

The thought of seeing the world through fresh eyes ignited a flicker of hope within me. It was as if
a small spark had been ignited, illuminating the darkness that had clouded my heart since Stacie's
departure. With Rachel's encouragement and the prospect of this trip, I began to see a glimmer of
light at the end of the tunnel.  She began the difficult task of arranging childcare for her two
children (3 and 5).

And there was more to this journey than just the two of us. My son Josiah, despite his own
responsibilities, decided to join us on this cruise. He was able to schedule vacation time from 
his biotech job.

Although their children and jobs made it
impossible for them to be away for a whole month, the trip's itinerary made it feasible for them to
explore Scandinavia alongside me. Having Josiah by our side added an extra layer of support, as we
knew we could lean on each other during the challenging moments we might encounter.

As we started planning the trip, it became clear that this was not merely a vacation. It was an
opportunity for us to reclaim our lives, to find solace in new experiences, and to honor Stacie's
memory in the process. The destinations we would visit held the promise of healing, as we immersed
ourselves in the beauty of nature and the rich cultures of Scandinavia.

Little did we know that this trip would become a catalyst for transformation. It would push us out
of our comfort zones, allowing us to grow and embrace life again. Each new place we visited would
hold significance, helping us shed our grief and embrace the joy that still existed in the world.

We are ready to embark on this journey with open hearts and open minds, ready to let go of the pain
that had consumed us. We understood that healing would not happen overnight, but we were determined
to take this first step toward redemption.

Now we took a step away from despair and embraced the
possibility of a bright future. Although there are still challenges ahead, we will not
face them alone. All of us together, will navigate the uncertain waters of grief, finding solace in
each other's company and the beauty of the world that surrounded us.

We are ready to write a new chapter in our lives, one that would redeem the
loss we have experienced and pave the way for a future filled with love, laughter, and cherished
memories.
