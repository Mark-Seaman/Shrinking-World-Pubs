# Week 6 - My Life Quests

## [Day 36 - The Four Quests of Life](/after/36.md)

I believe that each stage of my life has been defined by a quest.  Meeting the challenges of each quest has been the
defining measure of my success.  I have been driven by the quest and it has been ultimately tied to my happiness and
self-worth.  It has been impossible to be fulfilled without completing the quest.


## [Day 37 - The Quest for Identity](/after/37.md)

We each long for a sense of belonging and a place in the world.  We must integrate all of the needs of others and our own
needs to gain an understanding of how to function.  If we fail to gain this understanding then it is impossible to function 
well and develop a healthy identity.  


## [Day 38 - Quest for Success](/after/38.md)

Success as an adult was defined by creating a family and career that I wanted.  Stacie and I worked hard to build a life
that we were proud of.  We were successful in our careers and in our family.  This dominated our lives for two decades.


## [Day 39 - The Quest for Purpose](/after/39.md)

My 40s and 50s were a time of re-evaluating my life and finding purpose.  I was successful in my family and career but now needed to
find meaning and purpose in my life.  I needed to find a way to make a unique contribution to the world.  Happiness and fulfillment
become more about making a difference in the world than about personal success.


## [Day 40 - The Quest for Understanding](/after/40.md)

Turning 60 was a time of reflection and understanding.  I had completed the first three quests and was ready for the
final quest.  I was driven by the need to truly understand the meaning of life.  I wanted to know not just how to do
things but how to teach others how to do things.
