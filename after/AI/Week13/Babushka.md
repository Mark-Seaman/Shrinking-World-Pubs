# Babushka Dolls

I have always been intrigued by Russian nesting dolls, also known as Babushka dolls. These dolls are
made up of multiple layers, each one fitting inside the other. Little did I know that these dolls
would come to symbolize my own journey of self-discovery and restoration over the past seven
weeks.


## Disintegration of My Life

In 2023, my life began to unravel. Layer by layer, I felt parts of myself slowly fading away. It was
a systematic deconstruction that left me with very little by the end of the year. My well-being was
at stake, and I struggled to find a way to rebuild.

It took almost a year for this to happen and I could not understand what was taking place at the 
time.  Only in retrospect can I appreciate the layers of loss that I endured.  Issues that lay
dormant for years were suddenly causing problems in my life.

The layers of my life that I lost included my way of life, joy, hope, peace, safety, identity, and
purpose. It all started with me trying to juggle too many responsibilities, leading to a breakdown
in my way of life. Eventually, I found myself devoid of any sense of purpose or direction.

At the end of year I lost Stacie and my loss was almost complete.  Not only was I without my 
primary companion but was dealing with deep unresolved trauma before her death.  Is there life after
death for me?  This became a burning question on my mind.


## Restoration of My Layers

Over the recent weeks, I have felt a shift in my life. Each layer that had been stripped away was now
being restored. It goes beyond just returning to the original state – I am gaining fresh insights
and understanding in each area of my life. It's a process I never expected, and it has been truly
transformative.

Today, I finally found words to describe this process. I realized that the loss occurred from the
outermost layer of my life down to the core. And now, restoration is happening in reverse –
starting from the inside and working its way out. Each Babushka doll represents a key aspect of my
psyche that needed transformation.

The process of restoration for me occurred in a specific order with each layer about a week apart.

- Sense of Purpose
- Safety & Security
- Sense of Identity
- Peace
- Hope
- Joy
- Way of life


## Rebirth and Renewal

As life began to reemerge, I was surprised by the renewed sense of purpose and meaning. I started
documenting my journey and found that it could be a source of inspiration for others. Gradually, my
identity as a writer, teacher, and innovator was restored, bringing with it a sense of peace, hope,
and joy that I had been missing.

Part of me wondered whether I could ever be whole again.  I wanted to believe that my life had not
come to an end, despite the evidence to the contrary.  I invested all of my time and energy into 
the activities and thought patterns that could bring health.  I continued to wait patiently for a 
miracle to occur.  

During week 6 of my new life I began to feel stirring that took me by surprise.  And soon I was 
enveloped by a tidal wave of healing and restoration.  By week 13 I realized that I felt alive again.

I can hardly explain the joy I feel today.
Not only do I believe that I will be OK - but that I am already OK.  For the first time in a long
while I feel an excitement about life.


## Moving Forward

This journey has brought me clarity on how I want to live my life moving forward. I am committed to
making time for personal growth, to showing love and generosity, and to only pursuing what feels
right and healthy for me. It's a new beginning, filled with hope and possibilities.

In a few weeks, I will be traveling to Estonia, and I plan to bring back a Babushka doll as a
reminder of this miraculous journey of resurrection, one layer at a time. These past seven weeks
have been the most profound experience of my life. Today marks the start of a new chapter, one
filled with growth, love, and authenticity.
