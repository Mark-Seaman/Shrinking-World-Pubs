# Babushka Dolls

I've always been fascinated by the Russian nesting dolls (Babushka Dolls).

Over the last 7 weeks I have seen aspects of my life come alive.  Throughout 2023 my entire life disintegrated around me. Layer by layer a part of myself died.  By the end of the year I had little left.  This was a systematic deconstruction that ultimately claimed my well-being.

Over the recent weeks I have felt each of these layers being restored to health.   The restoration has gone far beyond the original health for each area leaving me with fresh understanding and insights.  

I never could have imagined that restoration would happen in this way.  I am quite surprised and have never heard anyone else describe the process that I have personally experienced.  Only today, I was able to name the layers for the first time.

I realize that loss occurred from the outer most nesting doll to the innermost.  And that restoration happened in the reverse order.  In other words, my life was stripped to its core and then rebuilt layer by layer.  Each Babushka (Russian for grandma) represented a key area of my psyche requiring transformation.

From the outside the layers are:

- Way of life
- Joy
- Hope
- Peace
- Safety
- Identity
- Purpose

The initial loss that I suffered was with my way of life.  As I was attempting to manage three full-time careers, my life degenerated into a frenzy of long work hours every week.  And gradually everything else began to fall apart.

The last loss that I experienced was a loss of purpose and meaning.   I've always had a strong sense of purpose that drives me forward.  Accomplishments are a way for me to keep score and be convinced that my life is worthwhile.  Yet by the end of 2023, I had lost all sense of purpose and meaning.  I could think of no reason to get up in the morning.  

At that time I viewed myself as a zombie walking through a desert wasteland waiting for some sort of a reanimation.  I did retain the consistent belief that eventually I would be resurrected but I expected it to require more than a year or two.

When life started to emerge I was quite surprised. The first awareness I had was of a renewed sense that my life did indeed have meaning.  I realized that I was in a unique position to document my journey of life after a devastating loss.  I continued to write and publish my daily thoughts and challenges.  Soon I realized that this might actually help others.

The following two weeks saw a restoration of my identity moving forward as a writer, teacher, and innovator, followed by a lifted sense of dread I had been living with.  Soon I was quite surprised by the suddenly restored peace, then hope for the future, then joy.  I realized that it had been well over a year since I had experienced sustained joy.

And finally, this week has given me clarity about the way that I will live my life from now on.  I will make space for personal growth by managing how I spend my time.  I will learn to love people and move to new levels of generosity and honesty.   And most importantly I will no longer strive but will pursue only what feels natural and healthy.  

In a few weeks, I will be in Estonia.  I will be returning with a Babushka doll to serve as a constant reminder of the miracle of resurrection (layer by layer).  The last seven weeks have been the most profound time I have ever experienced.  Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
