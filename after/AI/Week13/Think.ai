# Thriving Mentally 

- Managing what I think
- I am responsible for my worldview
- I will not try to extract affirmation from others
- I can't control my circumstances
- Well-being will be my success measure 
- I will monitor how I spend my time


Make each of the bullets into a heading and write one paragraph for each.
