## Painful Realizations

As I've been working through the Prometa Postmortem, I keep uncovering painful revelations. Initially, I thought my main anger stemmed from Prometa not utilizing the software. However, delving deeper, I realized a deeper issue â€“ feeling trapped and forced into a death spiral. This was fueled by Stacie's lack of self-care, her pathological generosity. She was willing to sacrifice me as collateral damage to make the heroic sacrifice. This tension had long persisted in our relationship, and I grew to believe she was justified in her beliefs and values.

## Denial and Recognition

I was actively operating in denial, thinking I needed to be more like Stacie. Over the last ten years, I've worked harder than ever, producing value for others. Despite this, I have not made a living. I've felt unappreciated, exploited, ignored, unrewarded, and sometimes victimized. Attempts to discuss this with Stacie were in vain, as each time, I felt unheard, deepening the distance between us.

## Lack of Support and Emotional Neediness

Stacie believed I required an inappropriate amount of recognition, viewing it as immaturity on my part. Her perspective hindered any real discussion about my needs for support or recognition. I had hoped for encouragement in my creative endeavors as a writer, teacher, and innovator, yet Stacie's support was limited to interactions with people. My attempts to address my social anxiety were dismissed as a personal flaw needing correction, further straining our relationship.

## Unaddressed Issues and Resentment

I made concerted efforts to support Stacie in her professional life as a life coach, constantly providing encouragement. However, I never felt valued for my creativity or received emotional support regarding my social anxiety. Stacie seemed to resent my emotional neediness, leading to unresolved conflicts in our relationship. The repressed problems that emerged posthumously shed light on the true nature of our bond, leaving me less content than before.

## Harsh Realities

Upon reflection, I realize that while I once believed our relationship was the best I knew, underlying issues and unmet needs tarnished our closeness. The stark realization of these repressed problems has altered my perceptions significantly. There is an irrevocable shift in how I view our past interactions, highlighting the unaddressed conflicts that lay dormant for years. The bittersweet truth has unveiled the complexities of our relationship, challenging my previous contentment and revealing the harsh reality we once shared.
