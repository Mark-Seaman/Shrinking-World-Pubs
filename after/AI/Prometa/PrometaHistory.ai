# Project History

My expectation:  I commit to 32 hours/month to develop software for Prometa.

Prometa: The biggest need is to develop a registration system.

Stacie: She was put in charge of the project management because of both expertise and temperament.  Her commitment was to provide exactly what Prometa asked for work to minimize the cost to Prometa.

Mark: In February I built a schedule that would allow us to release software on September 1, 2023 (in time for UNC class).

Stacie: Work began with Prometa and scope of project rapidly increased.  She was adamant about each new feature that was added.  We added features but never adjusted the schedule.

Mark: By April we were 50% behind the schedule.  We should have reset the schedule (moving from 8 months to 24 months).

We had increasing conflict weekly from April and my solution was to work more hours and ignore the growing resentment I felt.

We released software on September 1, 2023 and every week for the next 8 weeks.  Release 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8

Stacie worked on training Prometa staff and they were going to use the software for bimester starting Oct 10, 2023.

By Nov 1, Stacie was so ill she couldn't work.  I continued teaching the classes at UNC until the week before she passed.
