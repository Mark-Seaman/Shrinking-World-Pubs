## Painful Realizations

Working through the aftermath of the Prometa project, I've been hit with some harsh truths.
Initially, I was angry that our software wasn't utilized as I had hoped. But as I dig deeper, I see
a bigger issue â€“ feeling trapped and pushed into a downward spiral. 

Stacie exhibited extreme generosity her entire life. 
Stacie's self-sacrificing nature, willing to throw me under the bus for the greater good, fueled
this tension in our relationship. I began to believe her actions were justified, causing me to feel
suffocated.

Her commitment to the welfare of others was an example that I could never emulate.  This left me
feeling somehow defective and ashamed of who I am.

I am extremely creative and project focused.  I never felt valued for my creativity, but felt 
judged for my social awkwardness or lack of desire to please others.  Creative is not just what
I do but who I am this really hurt me.

I found myself in denial, convinced that I needed to emulate Stacie's behavior. I tried to follow her 
example by being very involved with people. But the activities that brought her joy failed to 
excite the same for me.



## Need for Recognition

My career has been at a standstill for ten years now. I poured my heart and soul into my work.  I
ran a business, wrote books, taught college, created courses, and built an online school.  All of
this work was almost completely unrewarded. I felt unappreciated, used, overlooked, and at times,
taken advantage of. 

Trying to discuss these feelings with Stacie only pushed us further apart, leaving me feeling
unheard and unnoticed and quite frustrated.  She valued the unseen hero making the ultimate 
sacrifice.  She could never understand my need for recognition.

Seeing my career implode over the last decade has created deep wounding and not being understood
of supported by Stacie has amplified the hurt.

It has been 17 years since I left HP and I can't recall a single time of recognition or appreciation
for my work since then.  Stacie viewed this as an illegitimate need that I must deny.  At HP I got
regular feedback about the quality of my work from my bosses and team members.  Since then I have
worked completely alone.

I published around 2,000 pages of content online so far and Stacie rarely commented on it.  When I
tried to tell her about my latest project. She would grow impatient quickly and switch the
subject.  This left me feeling bewildered and alone.


## Lack of Support and Emotional Neediness

Stacie thought I craved too much recognition, dismissing my need for support as immaturity. She
failed to understand my longing for encouragement in my creative pursuits as a writer, teacher, and
inventor. 

Instead, her support was limited to my social interactions.  She managed our social agenda and our
lives were filled with many activities with others.  She had a lot of friends and we did most of 
life as a team activity.  With her, relationships mattered most.

Project never interested her unless they involved helping people.  She viewed my creative activities
as time that should be better spent building relationships.  I do not really get that much joy from
being around others leaving me struggling with my
social anxiety alone. My attempts to address this issue were met with criticism, adding more strain
to our already fragile relationship.

I didn't realize until now how deep the fault-lines went.  We had serious issues that damaged our
relationship.   I realize that denial was one of my main coping skills.


## Unaddressed Issues and Resentment

While I showered Stacie with support in her career as a life coach, I received little validation for
my own creative endeavors. The lack of emotional support for my struggles with social anxiety led
to underlying tensions and unresolved conflicts between us. Stacie's apparent resentment towards my
emotional needs only deepened the rift in our relationship, creating a sense of discontentment that
lingered beneath the surface.

We took a Spiritually Healthy Relationships course two years ago and learned several skills that
helped us.  The most useful skill was how to analyze when one of your core values has been violated
and how to talk it out with the person.

I tried to work through these issues using the framework that Pete Scazzero gave us.  While it gave
me tremendous clarity, it did nothing to help Stacie understand my viewpoint.  Ultimately, I gave
up on helping her to understand me and chose to live at peace.  I resigned myself to the reality
that we had.


## Harsh Realities

Reflecting on our relationship, I once believed it was strong and fulfilling. However, as hidden
issues came to light after Stacie's passing, my perception has shifted drastically. The unspoken
conflicts and unmet needs that plagued our relationship for years have colored my memories with a
newfound clarity. The harsh truth of our dynamic has reshaped my understanding of our past,
challenging the picture of contentment I once held and revealing the raw reality of our connection.

If she we here today, I believe that we would have been able to break through the barriers. But we
will never know.  I've been left to imagine what might have been.  For now, I am contending with 
painful memories of lost hopes and dreams.
