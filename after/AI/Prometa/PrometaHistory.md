# Project History

## My Initial Expectation

When I first committed to dedicating 32 hours per month to developing software for Prometa, I had a
clear vision in mind. The main goal was to create a registration system that would cater to their
specific needs. I was excited to embark on this project and eager to see the end result.

Stacie and I agreed to work as a team with her covering the connection with Prometa and me developing
the software. She would meet weekly to coordinate with the organization on requirements and eventually
train the people that would be using the system.


## The Project Dynamics

Stacie, with her expertise and suitable temperament, was entrusted with project management
responsibilities. She aimed to fulfill Prometa's requests while minimizing costs. The project
timeline was set for a release date of September 1, 2023, aligning with existing commitments.
I was scheduled to teach a software engineering class at University of Northern Colorado
that still needed to be written.

In January, I created an online school to teach technology skills (software engineering, web
application development, and AI). Teaching online and at the university could easily have been two
full-time jobs. To do the Prometa project would require reducing the other two careers from an
investment of 1000 hours to 660 hours. This would fit within a 40 hour work week.


## Project Challenges

As work commenced with Prometa, the scope of the project began to expand rapidly. Stacie was adamant
about integrating new features into the software, leading to an increase in workload. Despite the
evolving requirements, the project schedule remained unchanged.

Every software feature can be implemented the easy way or the hard way.  Stacie believed that each
feature should be done the most sophisticated way and was unwilling to compromise on anything. She
also felt that we had made a clear commitment to the initial release date.  


## Escalating Issues

By April, we found ourselves significantly behind schedule, with a 50% deviation from the initial
plan. 

We budgeted to do a eight month project at the development investment we could afford.  With the
scope creep the project was now a 24 month project. From April we had daily arguments about the
requirements and the schedule.  

The logical step would have been to reassess and extend the timeline to accommodate the
additional work. However, this adjustment was never made, leading to inevitable conflicts within the
team.

Stacie would not be moved on either the functionality or schedule.  In software development this is
known as a Death March, and I had avoided this throughout my entire career.


## Coping Mechanisms

In an attempt to mitigate the growing tension, I resorted to increasing my work hours and
disregarding the underlying resentment festering within me. This coping mechanism, though
unsustainable, allowed us to push forward and ultimately deliver the software on time.

The eventual outcome was as inevitable as it was tragic.  We were on a collision course with
disaster.  I rarely slept through the night, was working through the night, and we canceled three 
different family vacations.  

Our lives became a living nightmare.  There was time for little else and I worked 60 hours every
week.  We blew through every guardrail to get the job done. And it was soon to have tragic
consequences for us both.

I was trapped by a deep fear of Stacie's disapproval, so I pushed on doing things that I knew were
wrong.  If I would have had the courage to stand up to Stacie in April we could have prevented the
disaster that followed.  This is the greatest regret of my lifetime.


## The Bill Comes Due

By July I was in serious trouble on the software engineering class.  I needed to develop a textbook
and course materials for the lectures and projects.  This would require about 500 hours to complete.
Yet each time I attempted to work on the class, Stacie would push me to work on the Prometa project.

The crisis finally erupted the Friday before classes at UNC.  Stacie was to travel to Costa Rica
for training on the software. Instead she went to the hospital with chest pains.  It turned out to
be stress from the insane life we were living.

I sat in the hospital room with my laptop trying to create some content for my class on Monday.
Teaching a college class with no preparation is the most humiliating thing I have ever done in 
my professional career.


## Release and Iterations

Following months of intensive work, we managed to release the software on September 1, 2023.
Subsequent updates were rolled out weekly, with versions 1.0 through 1.8 being implemented to
enhance functionality and address any issues that arose.

Stacie took charge of training the Prometa staff on how to effectively utilize the software for the
upcoming bimester starting October 10, 2023. Her dedication to ensuring a seamless transition was
evident, despite the challenges faced throughout the project.

We made sure that all of our work would be ready for the bimester that started on October 10, 2023.
This coincidentally was the date that Stacie first went to the doctor to investigate intense
abdominal pains.  We continued to work for another three weeks until Stacie was to sick.


## The End Game

On Halloween we got the first scan that showed tumors on multiple organs. It was clear that Stacie
would likely die, but no one would ever have guessed that it would only be six weeks.

I continued to teach at UNC and turned in grades the week before Stacie passed.  November was spent
trying to get set up for chemo, which was finally set for the day after she died.

This project challenged us in ways we never expected, pushing us to our limits both professionally
and emotionally. Despite the setbacks and conflicts, we managed to deliver a product that met
Prometa's needs.  

But the project broke our partnership and both of us personally.  This will always be my last 
memory of working together.  I know that if Stacie were still alive that we would be able to repair
the partnership and redeem our time working together.  But the clock expired before with had the
chance leaving only remorse and regret.
