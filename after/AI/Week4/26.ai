# Day 26 - Construction Process

Just like any construction process, rebuilding your life after loss requires time, effort, and
patience. Here are some essential steps to guide you through this process:

- **Embrace brokenness -** Give yourself permission to feel the pain, grief, and sadness.
    Acknowledge and accept your brokenness as part of the healing process.

- **Accept what is (detachment) surrender -** Understand that you cannot change the past. Practice
    acceptance and surrender to what you cannot control.

- **Celebrate progress -** Even small steps forward should be acknowledged and celebrated. Each tiny
    victory is a testament to your strength and resilience.

- **Find joy -** Seek out moments of joy and happiness in your life, no matter how small. Embracing
    joy can help counterbalance the pain and sadness.

- **Connect with others -** Allow yourself to lean on others for support and guidance. Building a
    strong support network will help you through the tough times and celebrate the good ones.
