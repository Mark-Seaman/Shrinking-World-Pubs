### Day 6 - Better Together

Navigating the grief process and rebuilding your life is not something you have to do alone.
Remember, you are not alone in this journey.

- **Others care for me -** Surround yourself with people who genuinely care about your well-being.
    Lean on them when you need a shoulder to cry on or a listening ear.

- **I care for others -** Extend your compassion and care to others who may be going through similar
    struggles. Helping others can be healing for both parties involved.

- **Self-awareness -** Foster a deeper understanding of yourself and your emotions. Take time to
    reflect inward and cultivate self-awareness throughout this rebuilding process.

- **Safety and security -** Prioritize creating a safe and secure environment for yourself
    emotionally, physically, and mentally. Your well-being should be a top priority.
