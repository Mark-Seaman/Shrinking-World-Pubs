# Day 4 - Traffic Pattern

As you navigate through the different rooms of your new life, it's important to establish a healthy
traffic pattern. This pattern is not just about the "what" but also the "how" of how you interact
with yourself and others.

- **Beyond "what" to "how" -** Shift your focus from just going through the motions to being present
    and intentional with your actions. The process matters as much as the outcome.

- **The means is the message -** How you go about rebuilding your life is just as important as the
    end result. Be authentic, genuine, and true to yourself.

- **My rules -** Establish your own rules for how you want to live and interact with the world. Some
    suggestions include:

    - Be authentic - Show up as your true self, embracing your strengths and vulnerabilities.

    - Embrace brokenness - Understand that you don't need to be perfect. Healing comes from
      accepting and embracing your brokenness.

    - I control me - While you can't control others, you have the power to control your own actions
      and reactions. I will also not take responsibility over how others behave, interact, or what 
      they think or feel.  

    - Live in the moment - Focus on the present rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about
      the future.

    - Meaningful conversations over group involvement - Prioritize deep and meaningful connections
      over superficial engagements.

    - Full engagement or avoidance - Be fully present and engaged in activities that bring you joy,
      or be aware when it's time to step away and take care of yourself.
