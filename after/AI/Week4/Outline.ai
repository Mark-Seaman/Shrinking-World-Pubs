# Time to Rebuild

The House Burned Down

The Plan to Rebuild

Floor Plan
- Living Room - social center
- Study - learning center
- Studio - creative center
- Coffee shop - writing center
- Home theater - experience center
- Kitchen - physical center

Traffic Pattern
- Beyond "what" to "how"
- The means is the message
- My rules
    - Be authentic
    - Embrace brokenness - not perfection
    - I control me - I don't control others
    - Live in the moment
    - Meaningful conversations over group involvement
    - Full engagement or avoidance

Construction Process
- Embracing brokenness
- Accept what is (detachment) surrender
- Celebrate progress
- Find joy
- Connect with others

Better Together
- Others care for me
- I care for others
- Self-awareness
- Safety and security

The Construction Process
