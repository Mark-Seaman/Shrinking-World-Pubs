## Day 19: Loss Redeemed

Several weeks after Stacie died, my daughter Rachel approached me.  She asked me how I would feel about going on the
trip with her.  This changed everything for me.   No longer would this be a trip of despair and loneliness, but one of
new beginning. 

We would both be able to confront our loss together and lean on each other as we sought to build a new life without
Stacie. This trip could mark a new start and help us see the world through fresh eyes.

Now,  my son Josiah will also be joining us on the cruise.  Both of them have kids and jobs that prevent them from being
gone for a whole month. But the trip itinerary makes it easy for them to tour Scandinavia with me.
