## Day 20: Join the Adventure

The first  two weeks will be the solo voyage from Florida to Amsterdam.  Josiah and Rachel will join me in Amsterdam,
and we will go together to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Germany.  Each day is a new port and the hotel
moves at night.

Now that I am going, I am hoping to invite some friends with me.  Check out this article I about 
[Exploring the World](https://seamansguide.com/journey/Cruise.md)
wrote shortly after we booked the trip.  It shows the itinerary and cost for the trip in case you might be interested in
joining me.
