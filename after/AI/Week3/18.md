## Day 18: Opportunity to Write

In the days at sea I was intending to finish my autobiography that I have been working on for several years.  Stacie has
helped others write and publish their life story, and I was going to help Stacie write her story.  But time ran out for
both of us.

The trip became a constant reminder of all that had been lost.  We longed for a time after the rat race when we could
celebrate our life together.  The thought of taking a voyage by myself was utterly unthinkable.

I left the reservations in place, but had no intention of going.  There were many other issues that required my
attention after Stacie's death.
