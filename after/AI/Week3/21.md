## Day 21: Surrounded by Love

My kids Josiah and Rachel have agreed to go with my on a Scandinavian cruise.

Stacie and I booked the trip shortly before she fell ill.  

What had been a reminder of loss has found been turned into joy.

I am so grateful that I will have two of my kids with me on this trip.  

This has touched me very deeply.

I am also grateful for the many friends who have reached out to
me in my time of need.  


I am surrounded by love and support.  

I am not alone. 

So many people have poured out their kindness 
and generosity to me.  


I am truly blessed.  


I am also humbled by to be the recipient of so much love.
