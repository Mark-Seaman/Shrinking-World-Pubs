## Day 15: Need to Retire

Throughout 2023 Stacie and I work an insane number of hours.  We found ourselves completely overcommitted and felt
unable to renegotiate.  As a consequence we canceled three family vacations that we had planned.

By October we agreed that we would no longer live like that.  We recognized that our lives had devolved into an endless
grind and the need to find enjoyment in activities that were not done for others.

We decided that our careers needed to stop being so consuming.  We were ready to retire.  Next year we would go on
medicare and it was time to get off the hamster wheel. Indeed, I had already retired at least five times but it never
stuck.
