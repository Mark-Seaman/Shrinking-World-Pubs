## Day 16: Retiring For Real

We have not made any real money for 10 years now so in that sense we have been economically retired for a long time.
This year I found myself trying to balance three full-time careers, and working 60 hours/week all year.  I was killing
myself and dragging Stacie along with me.

We decided that when classes were done that I would no longer teach at the university where I had been for seven years.
My college professor days were over.  Our involvement in writing application software would be reduced  for Prometa to
one day per week for each of us (from four days).

I had built an online school and would continue to produce classes but no longer strive to sell them.  Not only would
would our need for income end, but the inevitable stress of working for others needed to stop.  We would continue to do
creative work but only on our own terms.
