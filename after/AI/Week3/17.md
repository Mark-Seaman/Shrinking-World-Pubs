## Day 17: Ocean Cruise

To mark this change in attitude we booked an ocean cruise.  It would be a month long, which was longer than any vacation
we had ever taken in our lives.  Never had we allowed ourselves to be off the clock for so long.  It was an extravagant
way to mark our new life together.

We were to travel by ship from Ft. Lauderdale and visit numerous countries including eight new countries we had never
been too.  This was a trip of a lifetime.  Unfortunately, her lifetime was too short. Stacie fell ill a week after
making the reservations and died a few weeks later.

Every time I thought of the trip I broke out in tears.  Of course, we had many fantastic trips together all over the
world.  But this trip was the beginning of our new life together.
