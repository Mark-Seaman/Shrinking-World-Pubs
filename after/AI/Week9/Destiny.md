# Day ? - Living in Destiny

Living in destiny is about embracing the stage of life you are in and understanding the purpose that
comes with each stage. As we journey through life, our priorities and goals shift, and it's
important to navigate each phase with intentionality and mindfulness.


## The good life

How we measure success is a reflection of what we value most.  This changes as we age.  The challenges
that we face in our younger years are quite different that those we face in the midlife years.  
Young adults and elderly people value things quite differently.  How we see the good life is based
on the stage of life we are currently in.  Within twenty years it will look nothing like today.

In youth, we often seek to follow our desires and get our way. This stage is about exploration and
discovering who we are. As we transition into adulthood, the focus shifts towards achieving success
in our careers and personal lives. In midlife, we strive to make an impact and influence those
around us. And in old age, wisdom becomes our guiding light, as we reflect on our experiences and
lessons learned.


## Created for a purpose

Each one of us is unique, with our own set of gifts and talents. Living in destiny means embracing
our authenticity and living a life that aligns with who we truly are. Self-awareness plays a
crucial role in this journey, as it allows us to understand our strengths and weaknesses, and make
choices that reflect our true selves.

Our strengths and personalities stay remarkably consistent throughout our life.  Each life stage
bring new circumstances and concerns and values and beliefs.  But our fundamental personality remains
unchanged.  Creative types and social butterflies will continue being who they are at their core.
Destiny is living a life that is authentic to who you are meant to be.  Even as your life demands
very different things with each new season.


## Doing/Being - Path to Transformation

Living in destiny is not just about what we accomplish, but also about who we are becoming. It's a
journey towards wholeness, where we cultivate virtues such as humility, faith, hope, and love.
Understanding and accepting the darker aspects of our nature is also important, as it allows us to
grow and evolve as individuals.

Transformation is a requirement to be authentic.  People who are not living a life of health can never 
do what they were meant to do because they are not the people they were meant to be.  Living out
your false identity will lead to a false destiny.  Personal transformation is the only path to
authentic living that will let you walk out your destiny.


## Living in Destiny

Living in destiny requires us to look within and align our actions, words, thoughts, and emotions.
True transformation comes from a deep understanding of ourselves and a willingness to change and
grow. When we live from the inside out, we are able to create a life that is fulfilling and
meaningful.

In conclusion, living in destiny is about embracing the journey of life with intentionality and
mindfulness. By understanding the purpose of each stage of life, living authentically, and focusing
on both our actions and our character, we can create a life that is truly fulfilling. Embracing who
we are and living with purpose can lead us to a life of peace, joy, and fulfillment.
