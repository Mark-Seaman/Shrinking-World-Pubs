## End to Striving

As I reflect on my journey over the past few weeks, I have come to a realization that striving for success can be exhausting. The constant pressure to achieve more and do better can take a toll on our mental and emotional well-being. I have learned that true success is not about constantly pushing myself to the limit, but rather finding a balance between ambition and self-care.

## From Doing to Being

I used to measure my success based on the number of tasks I completed each day. However, I have come to understand that success should not be solely defined by productivity. It is important to take time to simply be present in the moment, to enjoy the little things in life, and to take care of my inner self. I have shifted my focus from doing to being, and it has brought a sense of peace and fulfillment that I had been missing.

## Detach From Unrealistic Expectations

I used to set lofty goals for myself, expecting nothing less than perfection in everything I did. This mindset only led to disappointment and frustration when I fell short of my own unrealistic expectations. I have learned to detach myself from these harmful beliefs and to embrace my imperfections as part of my journey towards success. It is okay to make mistakes and to learn from them, as long as I continue to grow and evolve.

## From Goals to Priorities

Instead of setting rigid goals that may or may not align with my values and priorities, I have started to focus on what truly matters to me. By identifying my core values and setting priorities based on these values, I am able to make decisions that are in line with my authentic self. This shift in mindset has allowed me to live a more meaningful and purposeful life, free from the constraints of arbitrary goals.

## Sustainability

I have come to realize that success is not about achieving a single monumental goal, but rather about creating a sustainable and fulfilling lifestyle. It is important to take care of my physical, emotional, and mental health in order to thrive in the long run. By prioritizing self-care and making choices that support my well-being, I am able to sustain my success and happiness over time.

## Rules to Thrive

I have established a set of rules for myself that guide me towards a thriving life. These rules include practicing gratitude, staying true to my values, nurturing my relationships, and seeking growth and learning opportunities. By following these rules, I am able to navigate life's challenges with grace and resilience, and to live a life that is deeply fulfilling and meaningful.

## Fresh Start with Integrity

With this new measure of success in mind, I am embarking on a fresh start with integrity and authenticity. I am committed to living in alignment with my values, pursuing my passions with purpose, and treating myself and others with kindness and compassion. I am letting go of the need to impress others or to conform to societal expectations, and instead, I am embracing my uniqueness and individuality.

## Embrace the Journey

Success is no longer an elusive destination that I must strive towards, but rather a journey that I am actively participating in every day. By focusing on being instead of doing, detaching from unrealistic expectations, setting priorities based on my values, and prioritizing sustainability, I am able to thrive and succeed in a way that feels true to myself. I am grateful for this new perspective on success and excited to see where this journey will take me next.
