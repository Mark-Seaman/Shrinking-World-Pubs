# Grief Support Group

Since Stacie's death I have learned a lot about grief.

Everyone will experience profound loss.

Grief is very individual.  There is no wrong way to grieve.

Grievers feel isolated and alone.

We are part of a club we never wanted to join.

We need the support of one another.

No one needs to grieve alone.

We've started a grief support group.
