# Friends and family


I measure connection in hours

- Deep conversation requires hours to build trust
- Belonging to the same group doesn't count
- It's a lifetime investment that accumulates over decades

Connect by sharing

- Hopes and fears
- No need for shallow interactions
- I avoid groups and seek private interactions
- Ideally we share a meal

Forming connections

- I schedule encounters daily
- I also look for spontaneous encounters daily
- I invest with the energy I have
- I'm learning to live in the moment

Expectations of others

- In the past I attempted to influence and control others
- Now I consciously lay down my expectations of others
- I desire connection not control
- I guage my involvement on the desire of others to connect with me
