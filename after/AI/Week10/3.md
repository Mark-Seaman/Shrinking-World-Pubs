# Overcoming Anger

I have always struggled with managing my anger. As an idealist I see the world as it should be.
The actual world is often far from that ideal. This discrepancy between my expectations and reality would often lead to
feelings of frustration and anger. I typically avoided confrontations and outbursts by suppressing my emotions.
However, this only served to intensify my anger and resentment over time.

It took me years to realize that my anger was not healthy and an issue that I needed to address.  I've grown to
understand that anger is a symptom of not being in control of events and situations.  This feeling of powerlessness can
be fuel many different dysfunctional behaviors.

It wasn't until I made a conscious effort to understand and address my anger that I was able to make
significant progress in overcoming it.


## Identifying Triggers and Patterns

The first step in overcoming anger is to identify what triggers your emotions. For me, it was usually feelings of
frustration, insecurity, or powerlessness that would ignite my anger. By recognizing these triggers, I was able to
anticipate when my anger might surface and take steps to prevent it from escalating.


## Practicing Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques

Mindfulness and relaxation techniques played a crucial role in my journey to overcoming anger. By practicing
mindfulness, I was able to stay present in the moment and not let my emotions dictate my actions. Additionally,
relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga helped me to release pent-up stress and tension, leading to a calmer
and more balanced state of mind.


## Communicating Openly and Assertively

I learned that communication is key when it comes to managing anger. Instead of bottling up my emotions or lashing out
impulsively, I began to communicate openly and assertively with others. This meant expressing my feelings in a
constructive and non-confrontational way, allowing for healthier and more productive discussions.


## Humility is Key to Overcoming Anger

One of the most important lessons I learned on my journey to overcoming anger is that humility is key. It takes humility
to admit when we are wrong, apologize for our actions, and strive to do better in the future. By being humble and
willing to learn from our mistakes, we can make significant progress in managing our anger and building healthier
relationships with others.
