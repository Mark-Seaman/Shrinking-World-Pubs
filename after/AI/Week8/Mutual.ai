Mutual Commitment


I have run into a common antipattern repeatedly over the years.

When developing personal relationships or organizational commitments I have often had more desire for the connection than the other party.

In the past I spent a great deal of energy trying to get the other party to meet my commitment.

Now I try to let others gate the pace of the connection.  When I try to get together with others and it is difficult, I stop trying.  When they are ready I will reciprocate. This has brought me a great deal of peace.

I am now facing the task of developing relationships with about fifty people to fill the void in my social life.  I can't afford to spend energy with people that are not ready to engage.  Someday they may be ready.

Organizational relationships are somewhat different.  Organizations like church, the university, and non-profits have no soul.  I relate on a personal level to the people but I must also relate to the organization.

I try to balance what I am contributing to the organization with what it is costing me.  This totally transactional view determines how committed to be.

If being involved in an organization no longer is the best way for me to spend my life then there are plenty of opportunities that I could commit to.  I never allow a misguided sense of loyalty make me feel trapped into doing something that I know is not good for me.  Life is too short!
