# Who Am I?

## Discovering My Identity

I have always had a strong sense of identity. It has been a guiding force in my life, shaping how I
see myself and my place in the world. Five years ago, I developed a model to help define who I am
by asking myself a series of key questions. These questions delve deep into different aspects of my
being and help me gain clarity.


## The Key Questions

The questions I ask myself are:

1. What do I control?
2. How do I feel?
3. What do I have?
4. What are my goals?
5. Am I living in the present?
6. What do I need?
7. What will I give?


## Reevaluating Identity

After the passing of Stacie, my life changed irrevocably. Everything I once knew was tied to our
life together. Now, I find myself in a place of rebuilding, starting anew as Mark Solo. The answers
to these questions have shifted drastically over the past year, and I am faced with the task of
forging a new identity.


## Control and Emotions

I have come to realize that control is an illusion. Instead of trying to control everything around
me, I focus on controlling my reactions and responses to life's challenges. Understanding my
emotions has been key in this process, allowing me to navigate through grief and uncertainty with a
sense of mindfulness and self-awareness.


## Possessions and Goals

In terms of what I have, possessions no longer hold the same value they once did. Material things
have taken a backseat to experiences and relationships. My goals have shifted from career-focused
achievements to personal growth and meaningful connections with others.


## Living in the Present

Living in the present moment has become a daily practice for me. I no longer dwell on the past or
worry excessively about the future. Instead, I embrace each day as it comes, finding joy in the
simple moments and being grateful for the blessings in my life.


## Needs and Generosity

My needs have evolved as well. While I once sought external validation and success, I now prioritize
self-care, emotional well-being, and inner peace. In terms of giving, I find fulfillment in helping
others, whether through acts of kindness, volunteering, or simply being present for those in need.


## Embracing Change

As I continue on this journey of self-discovery and identity formation, I am learning to embrace
change and adapt to new circumstances. Life is a constant evolution, and my identity is fluid,
capable of growth and transformation. Who I am now is a reflection of my resilience, courage, and
capacity for love and connection.
