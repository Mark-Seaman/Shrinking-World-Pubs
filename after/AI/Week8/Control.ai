# What Do I Control?

Several years ago I realized that the central issue in my emotional health has been related to control.  

I remember as a ten-year old having the serenity prayer from AA on my wall ...

    Courage to change what I can 
    and acceptance for the rest
    
I spent over a year pondering the distinction between what I control and what I don't control. The final insight seems so simple as to overlooked as simplistic.  Instead it is quite profound providing the key to personal health.

I control me - I don't control others!

This has two critical parts.  Violating either of these truths leads to a path involving pain and suffering.  Working against both will result in ruin.  Let's take a closer look.


## I control me 


There are only four things that I have absolute control over.   I control what I do, say, think, and feel.  There are many other things that I can influence indirectly but control is not possible.   By controlling myself I can influence circumstances but the results are outside my control.

I control what I ...

- Do - My actions are choices with consequences.
- Say - How we interact with others determined our relationships and words matter.
- Think - What we believe and choose to think has a profound impact on our life.
- Feel - Overcoming the destructive power of negative emotions requires a huge amount of effort.

Controlling myself takes means taking responsibility to everything that lies within my control.  This is so difficult that most people refuse to do so, and insist that their actions, relationships, beliefs, values, and emotional problems are outside their control.

The quality of my life is a direct result of this one truth.  When I control me, I am living true, but when is refuse to do so, I am living falsely.  Bad circumstances will eventually follow.  When I live true I will experience hardship but with the maximum level of resilience.


 ## I don't control others


It is not enough to just be responsible for myself.  I must also relinquish responsibility for everything that I can't control.

As a lifelong control freak, I am used to controlling myself.  What I really struggle with, is accepting all that I can't control.  This makes be so angry, I will destroy myself trying to control everyone else.

Not accepting reality dooms you to a life of cynical bitterness.  Gradually you alienate everyone you talk to and end up isolated and alone.  

When I was in mid-life I believed that the highest level of understanding was the pursuit of purpose.  My 40s and 50s were spent attempting to make the world better by influence.  This often became an attempt to control others.

Most of my energy was devoted to controlling what others did, said, thought, and felt.  I believed that I was personally obligated the fix them and take control over them.  But when I turned 60, I realize how foolish this worldview was.  This was simultaneous with the pandemic and the political and social meltdown of 2020.

It was actually quite freeing to realize that the entire world is completely screwed up and that everyone I know is badly broken.  But it's not my fault, or my responsibility to fix.  I only have the responsibility to match the control that I have.

I must control myself - I don't control others!  My job is to accept reality as it is and learn to cope with whatever comes my way.  My energy is now available control what I do, say, think, and feel.  And it requires discernment to understand what I do control.

"God grant me the serenity,
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference."
