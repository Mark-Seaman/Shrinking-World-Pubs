# One Day at a Time

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. -- Janis Joplin

I am totally free now.

In my old life I was bound by constant activity.

I've always been a very ambitious person and had many projects going in parallel.

As I contemplate where life has taken me I am amazed at what I've accomplished.

26 years at the leading edge of technology, 12 patents, 6 books, 4 courses, online training school, world expert on OCR, 7 years as a professor, 12 years as a business owner, 100 software applications built, over 1 million lines of code written 44 years as a software developer, financial independence at 55

Yet this is all dust in the wind.

Accomplishments mean little after losing everything I truly value.

Today I'm a broken shell of a man, a small fraction of who I was a year ago.

As a ghost of my former self, I am awaiting resurrection, that I believe by faith will come.

Now the task is to make it through one more day, and try to imagine the good life.

Some days feel almost normal and I believe that I will live again.

Other days I need to celebrate the wonderful life that Stacie and built together.

One day at a time, as it comes. I am totally free now!
