# How do I feel?

I have an engineer's temperament.
I see what might go wrong and know how to correct it.
This makes me jugdmental, critical, and pessimistic.
Emotional management is a key to well-being.
My natural tendency is to be negative not possitive.
Management starts by realizing that I am responsible for how I feel and must take control or be swept away.
I am responsible for fostering joy, peace, and gratitude.
I am also responsible for how I deal with pain.
For me the four faces of pain are anger, fear, sadness, and shame.
I must overcome each of these.
