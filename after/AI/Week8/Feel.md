# What do I Feel?

Understanding and managing my emotions is a continuous journey that requires self-awareness,
introspection, and resilience. By taking responsibility for my feelings and actively working
towards emotional well-being, I can cultivate a more positive and fulfilling life.

Eight years ago I began studying how the brain deals with emotions.  I gained lots of insights
that have benefited me greatly.  I now understand that while I will experience emotions as they
happen that I also have a choice about the long term emotional state.  For example, when insulted
anger is automatic, but brooding and plotting revenge is a choice.


## Understanding My Temperament

I have always approached situations with an engineer's temperament. I possess the ability to foresee
potential problems and solutions. This mindset can make me judgmental, critical, and even
pessimistic at times. However, I believe this critical thinking is a valuable asset when it comes
to problem-solving and decision-making.

I've learned to appreciate my ability to the things that are wrong with myself and the world around
me. But I also recognize that there is a danger in being consumed by problems.  I must find a
healthy balance for my own peace of mind.


## The Importance of Emotional Management

Emotional management plays a crucial role in my well-being. As someone who naturally leans
towards a negative outlook, I understand the importance of taking control of my emotions rather
than letting them control me. I acknowledge that I am responsible for how I feel, and it is up to
me to foster feelings of joy, peace, and gratitude.

I solve problems.  That is what I do and who I am. But many things that are broken our outside of
my control.  I must learn to detach myself from the desire to control and concentrate on accepting
the reality that is.  This is the art of emotional management.

Anything that I can't control is not my responsibility and must learn to detach myself or self-destruct.


## Taking Responsibility for My Emotions

I have come to the realization that I am responsible for my own happiness. If I do not actively work
towards promoting positive emotions, I run the risk of being overwhelmed by negative thoughts and
feelings. By taking ownership of my emotions, I can steer myself towards a more balanced and
fulfilling life.

Pain manifests in various forms, which I have learned to call the four faces of pain: anger, fear,
sadness, or shame. Each of these emotions can be difficult to navigate, but it is crucial that I
learn to overcome them. By recognizing and addressing these sources of pain, I can work towards
healing and finding inner peace.

My ability to overcome the trauma in my life defines my mental, emotional, and spiritual.  Emotional
hijacking occurs when I allow runaway emotions to destroy my life.


### Overcoming Anger

Anger is a powerful emotion that can cloud my judgment and lead to destructive behaviors. By
acknowledging and addressing the root cause of my anger, I can learn healthier ways to express and
manage this emotion. Through self-reflection and self-control, I can overcome the grip of anger and
strive for a calmer state of mind.


### Confronting Fear

Fear has the ability to paralyze and prevent me from taking necessary risks or embracing new
opportunities. By confronting my fears head-on and challenging the negative beliefs that fuel them,
I can gradually reduce their hold on me. With courage and perseverance, I can move past my fears
and embrace a life filled with growth and possibility.


### Embracing Sadness

Sadness is a natural human emotion that serves as a signal of loss or pain. Instead of suppressing
or denying my sadness, I strive to embrace it with compassion and understanding. By allowing myself
to experience and process these feelings, I can eventually find acceptance and healing.


### Releasing Shame

Shame can be a crippling emotion that leads to feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt. By shedding
light on the sources of my shame and challenging the negative beliefs associated with it, I can
begin to release its hold on me. Through self-compassion and self-forgiveness, I can work towards
building a healthier relationship with myself.


## My New Life

What was an important issue in my life is now the very key to my survival.  As my life has 
deteriorated, powerful emotions threaten to destroy me.   I have a daily battle to overcome each
of these forms of pain.  While I let myself feel the pain I must set boundaries that I will not
cross.

I am working to develop new strategies that will improve my well-being.  Emotional health is a 
journey not a destination.  I hope that growing my awareness of how I am feeling and managing
those feelings will help me cope with the daily challenges of my new life.
