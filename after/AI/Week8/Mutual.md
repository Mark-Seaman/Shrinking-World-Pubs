# Mutual Commitment

I have learned the hard way about the importance of mutual commitment in both personal relationships
and organizational commitments. For years, I found myself constantly putting in more effort and
desire for connection than the other party involved. It left me feeling drained and unfulfilled.


## Setting Boundaries

Now, I have adopted a different approach. I allow others to dictate the pace of the relationship. If
I find that I am consistently the one reaching out and trying to make plans, only to be met with
resistance or disinterest, I take a step back. I let them come to me when they are ready. This
shift in mindset has brought me a sense of peace and balance.


## Finding Social Connections

Currently, I am in the process of building relationships with a group of about fifty individuals to
enhance my social life. I have realized that it is not worth my time and energy to constantly chase
after people who are not willing to reciprocate. Instead, I focus on those who are open and
receptive to forming a connection. Patience and understanding play a significant role in
maintaining mutual commitment.


## Balancing Organizational Commitments

When it comes to organizational relationships, such as those within church, university, or
non-profit settings, I approach them with a different perspective. While I value the personal
connections I make within these organizations, I also recognize the importance of assessing the
cost and benefit of my involvement. If my contributions outweigh the rewards I receive, I
reevaluate my commitment to ensure it aligns with my own well-being.


## Transactional Approach

I view my involvement in organizations as a transactional relationship. It is essential for me to
consider what I am giving to the organization versus what I am gaining in return. If I find that my
contributions are not being valued or that my time and energy would be better spent elsewhere, I am
not afraid to step back and explore other opportunities. My commitment is contingent upon the
fulfillment and growth I experience within the organization.


## Honoring Self and Others

Above all, I prioritize my own well-being and happiness in all commitments. I refuse to allow a
misguided sense of loyalty or obligation to keep me trapped in situations that do not serve me. It
is crucial to honor both myself and the other party involved by fostering mutual commitment that is
balanced and fulfilling. Life is too precious to waste on relationships and commitments that do not
add value and joy to it.
