# Group Gatherings

Some people like to interact with others in large groups

The more the merrier

This is no me, any group over four is too big

I desire to converse and this is difficult in a large group

I struggle to wait for the event to be over

The ideal group size is two to four

I hate small talk and favor deep conversations

I don't trust anyone that I have not had a heart-to-heart conversation with

This involves sharing ideas, hopes and dreams, and fears

I have little desire for smalltalk and view it as a social burden preventing trust

I struggle to embrace social norms that others intuitively understand
