# Survive Today - Thrive Tomorrow

Trauma destroys all of the margin in my life

It takes more than I have to give

I must survive today in order to build a new life someday

I can't contemplate my life through the same lens that I used before the trauma

I must release every idea of a good life and focus on making it through today (or the next hour)

I can only spend margin I have

Self-care is critical to survival

Thriving will come someday but not now
