# Daily Habits


What we do each day becomes automatic.  Activities that are repeated often enough take on a life of their own.  They influence our sense of identity and provide comfort and security.

Most of my daily activities and habits involved around Stacie.  Now that she is gone, none of the habits that I previously make any sense.  I must forge new habits for every specific activity in my new life. 

Finding a new normal is an incredibly difficult process, one fraught with emotional landmines.  I must undo decades of automatic responses to create a new programming script for my day.  

Over the next few weeks, I must determine what I want my daily activities to look like.  These will be set to match what I value moving forward.  I will commit to a set of practices that need to consume my time and energy.  I already have a sense of these priorities that will steer my future life.

With the commitments in place, I will begin to establish new habits. This will probably take a couple of months.  Studies show to it takes at least 30 iterations for habits to form.
