# Grief Isolates and Connects

Profound loss is a fundamental part of the human experience. It is a universal truth that we all must face at some point
in our lives. And yet, it is something we rarely talk about openly. We are taught to hide our grief, to keep it bottled
up inside. But this only serves to isolate us from one another and ourselves.

Grief is a natural response to loss. It is a process that we must go through in order to heal. And yet, it is often
misunderstood and stigmatized. During a time of profound loss, we are expected to be strong and stoic or to be overcome with
sadness.  This expectation is completely unrealistic.  

Grief is a complex emotion that can manifest in many different ways. It is not a linear process, but rather a series of ups
and downs. It is a rollercoaster of emotions that can be difficult to navigate. Because we have false expectations of how to 
grieve, we often end up feeling isolated and alone in our grief.

This is compouned when other have false expectations as well.  Others are unsure of what to say of do and this causes a 
fear that they will do something wrong.   They often fail to relate to us and can't understand what we are feeling.
In the end we walk alone and feel an isolation that can be profound.

But grief also puts us into a special club with other grievers.  It is a club that no one wants to join, but once you are 
in it, you are in it for life.  It is a club that is filled with people who understand what you are going through.
This can be a great source of comfort and support and hope.  There are people who truly understand.

I'm being very intentional about seeking a deep connection with those who understand grief.  I'm trying to be open and
honest and vulnerable about it.  This is a matter of survival for me.  I need to be able to talk about my grief and
not be misunderstood or judged.  I need to be able to talk about my grief and not feel like I'm burdening someone else.

We've started a group called "Good Mourning", named after a book and podcast. This will have two main components.  The
first is a monthly meeting where will have a potluk meal.
The second is a Marco Polo group where people can post videos to share your individual stories.

There is no reason to grieve alone.  There is no reason to feel isolated.  There is no reason to feel misunderstood.
