# Grief Isolates and Connects: A Journey to Healing

Grief is a profound experience that each and every one of us will face at some point in our lives. It is a universal truth, yet it remains a topic we rarely discuss openly. We are often taught to hide our grief, keeping it bottled up inside ourselves. But by doing so, we inadvertently isolate ourselves from both others and our own healing.

Loss is a natural part of life, and grief is our natural response to that loss. It is a necessary process that we must go through in order to heal. Unfortunately, grief is often misunderstood and stigmatized in society. In times of profound loss, we are expected to be strong and stoic, or completely overcome with sadness. These unrealistic expectations only serve to perpetuate our isolation.

Grief is not a linear process; it is a complex emotion that can manifest in many different ways. It is an unpredictable rollercoaster of emotions, making it difficult to navigate. With false expectations of how to grieve, we often find ourselves feeling isolated and alone in our grief.

This isolation is further compounded by the false expectations of others. People often don't know what to say or do when faced with someone who is grieving. They fear saying or doing something wrong, and as a result, they often fail to relate to us and understand what we are going through. This leaves us walking alone, feeling profound isolation.

However, grief also has a way of connecting us with others who have experienced loss. It creates a unique bond that no one wants to be a part of, but once you are in it, you are in it for life. This special club is filled with individuals who truly understand the depths of your pain. In this club, you can find comfort, support, and hope. There are people who know what you are going through and are willing to walk alongside you in your grief.

Recognizing the need for deep connection with fellow grievers, I have made a conscious effort to seek out those who understand the grieving process. I have decided to be open, honest, and vulnerable about my grief. For me, this is a matter of survival. I need to be able to talk about my grief without being misunderstood or judged. I need to be able to share my burden without feeling like I am a burden to someone else.

To facilitate this connection, we have formed a group called "Good Mourning," inspired by a book and podcast of the same name. This group will consist of two main components. Firstly, we will have a monthly meeting where we gather for a potluck meal. This will provide a safe space for us to share and support one another in our grief journeys. Secondly, we will have a Marco Polo group, where individuals can post videos to share their individual stories. This digital platform will allow us to connect and uplift one another, even when we cannot physically be together.

The message is clear: there is no need to grieve alone. There is no reason to feel isolated or misunderstood. We are not burdening others by sharing our grief; instead, we can find solace in the understanding and support of those who have walked a similar path. Together, we can navigate the complexities of grief and find healing, connection, and hope.
