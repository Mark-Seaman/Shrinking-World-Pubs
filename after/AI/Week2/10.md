# My Social Director

We all live in relationship

We must each have healthy social interactions daily to thrive

Stacie was temperamentally wired for relationships

Over time we specialized 

she was my social director and handled all of our social planning and interactions

 I handled the task oriented things

With her gone I am in danger of not having any social interaction unless I take necessary steps to ...

A great deal of my focus daily is to create deeper connections with others

This is a difficult and unnatural thing for me but critical to my survival

I have set the following guidelines for my new life

- Have 2 deeply meaningful conversations each day
- Avoid large groups where meaningful conversation is not likely
- Avoid interactions that are small-talk
- Renew old friendships that have been neglected
- Spend more time with my kids and grandkids
- Use Marco Polo to stay in daily contact with groups of people
- Prune casual interactions and relationships

Most of these guidelines focus on self-awareness and prioritizing those relationships that are life-giving.
