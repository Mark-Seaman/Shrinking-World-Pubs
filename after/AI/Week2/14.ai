# Pathway toward normal

Life has always been somewhat predictable

My wife lost her six week battle with cancer

My old life is gone

I must build a new life

As a software engineer I will design all of the aspects of my new life

As an author I will write a new story 

As a teacher I will instruct others on how to move forward after loss

As a human I will grieve, yet find hope for another day

This is my story written in real time as I live it

I will share my story with others, although each person's journey is unique

Hopefully my story will help others find their own pathway toward normal
