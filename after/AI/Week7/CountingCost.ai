# The Cost of Not Counting Cost


Every investment cost something.  It is important to count the cost and weigh it against the benefit.  This must be done before taking on any project commitments.  And as the project progresses there must be regular reviews to make adjustments to any expectations.

In 2023, we took on a project for a non-profit organization, with fairly modest expectations. I agreed to invest one day per week to create software for them.  Stacie would work with me on the project and make an equal investment.  When we are working well we are a fantastic team.

We started well enough in January.  By February we had a solid plan with monthly milestones that would get us to released software by September 1, when I would begin teaching class at the local college.

Development work begins with gathering the customer requirements.  Stacie worked with the organization to understand their needs while I began to create prototype code.

The schedule that I created assumed that I would have the flexibility to control the scope of the implementation.  As Stacie began defining the requirements she chose to most complex feature each time causing the scope to increase to 250% of what I had anticipated.

By April I realized that this project would require 1000 hours of effort (up from the 400 hour budget).  In April I knew that we needed to move the scheduled release date.  The project was no longer an 8 month project but a three year project at a reasonable investment.

Stacie and I strongly disagreed about how this should be handled.  She felt that we had made a iron-clad promise to the organization that could not be broken.  I knew that the project could not continue on that path without breaking us.  Within two months the project spiraled out of control and we were never able to resolve the conflict.

I lost the argument, and gave in for fear of Stacie's disapproval.  I chose to release software September 1 or die trying.  From April-December was a waking nightmare.  I recall spending hours sitting in front of the computer and accomplishing almost nothing due to the emotional distress I felt.

We released software September 1 and every week for the next eight weeks.  I failed at all my other professional endeavors. And in September we both decided to quit work and finally retire.  I would end my career as professor we would begin a life of leisure that was due us.

During the course of the project Stacie fell ill. By November 1st it was clear that Stacie was dying.  Only then did we quit working on the project.  Six weeks later she lost her short battle with cancer.

The greatest regret of my life was how we handled the disagreement over how much sacrifice was appropriate.  Stacie forced me into a no-win situation and my loss has been beyond calculation.
