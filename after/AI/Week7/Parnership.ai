# Beautiful Partnership

For 45 years now Stacie and I have been partners in everything we did.  I could never have hoped for a better partner.  Together we made one fantastic team.

We created a family and nurtured children and grand children over decades.  Life was seldom easy or smooth.  I can't imagine even navigating through it all if Stacie were not there to guide me.

We have both had several different careers that reflected our unique personalities. But we also stayed engaged in each others careers and aided where we could.  Throughout our life together we also had numerous opportunities to work as business partners.

We built software together, wrote and published books, taught classes, traveled the world, and did almost every type of ministry that you can name.  We were partners in every way and seldom apart.

Although we each had our own lives and sense of identity, we preferred working together.  We brought very different skills and personality and this was what made our partnership so successful.  We trusted each other with our lives and usually respected healthy boundaries.

When our partnership caused us relational stress our love and respect brought us back together.  Stacie loss has been profound and I will never have a partner like her again.  But I am learning to walk again.

I am so grateful for the partnership I had for so many years.  Every year together brought a deep sense of fulfillment.  Stacie is the best person I have ever known.  I had the joy of having her as my perfect partner.
