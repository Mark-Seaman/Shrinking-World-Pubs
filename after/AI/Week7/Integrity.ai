# What is Integrity?


A ship is said to have integrity when all of the parts are working well together.  When it loses integrity it will either sink to the bottom of the ocean or be stranded.

Dr. Henry Cloud defines integrity as a character that can meet the demands of reality.  Integrity includes avoiding moral failure but goes far beyond that. It is about health and wholeness in every aspect of life: emotional, mental, physical, moral, spiritual, and social.

When humans lose integrity they either self-destruct or fail to rise to their potential.  The consequence is the same - no human can live their destiny unless they maintain integrity.  It requires that we avoid the dysfunction in every area of life.

Humans are complex beings with many different facets.   Each person is responsible for what they do, say, think, and feel.  To have integrity is to have total consistency between what I do, say, think, and feel.  When everything is integrated together I live a life of wholeness and health. But when parts of my life become inconsistent then the whole breaks down.

Every person has remarkable strengths that make them unique and special.  When all is integrated we live life centered around our strengths. But every strength also has a fatal flaw that carries the seeds or our destruction.  Let me illustrate with a personal example.

Creative problem solving is the strength that lies at the heart of my identity.  In health this makes me focused, industrious, ambitious, intelligent, inquisitive, determined, confident, and capable of doing the impossible.  I have accomplished more in my life that most people would do in three lifetimes.

But this personality has a dark side.  I have difficulty with social interactions and relationships.  I typically find people annoying and struggle to adhere to social norms and conventions.  When I lose integrity, I become arrogant, judgmental, demanding, and hostile toward others.

My wife on the other hand was the polar opposite.  She was the most generous and caring person I have ever known.  She constantly thought of others and understood and valued how they felt.  She would give everything to help almost anyone, and was everyone's friend an confidant.

When she lost integrity, she would neglect her own self care.  Some times she would help others at great harm to herself.  She cared so much about pleasing others that this would leave her at their mercy.

Meeting our destiny means that we become the people we were designed to be, while avoiding the excess of the fatal flaws that threaten to destroy.  Wholeness and health result from fully engaging our strengths while minimizing our weaknesses.  This a careful balancing act.
