# Stacie's final tour

## December 20, 2024

What started as a routine errand quickly became one of the most poignant experiences of my life. I didn't intend to go on a tour, it just happened. In retrospect, it is the only thing I could have done.  Stacie has been gone a week now and we are working on planning her memorial. My thought are heavy as I try to imagine life without her.

## The Funeral Home and Our Old House

The first stop was the funeral home to pick up Stacy's remains and the death certificates. The funeral home was located just a couple of blocks from our old house in Greeley. The car automatically took me to visit our old house. I stood for a while and looked at the house that Stacy and I built, the house where we raised our kids, the house where we lived for 17 years.

## Memories Flood Back

We left Greeley to move to a small nearby town 14 years ago. I have rarely been back and was surprised at all the changes. Our previous house was only about a mile away and soon the car found its way there. The old house was next to Woodbriar Park. The park had changed completely as did the house. This was our first house in Greeley. We moved in when we were 25 and lived there for 7 years.

## Fat Albert's and Cherished Memories

The car soon took me to Fat Albert's, a classic restaurant in Greeley. We ate there when we were on our house-hunting trip before we moved to Colorado. It is the only restaurant I can think of that still exists. They have a cherry pie that is bested only by my mother's pie. The memories come in like a flood with potent meaning. Stacie and I both agree it has been a wonderful life!
