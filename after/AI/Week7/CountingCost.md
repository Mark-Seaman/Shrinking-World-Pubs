# The Importance of Counting Costs

Every investment has a cost, whether it be financial, time, or emotional. It is crucial to carefully
consider and evaluate the costs before committing to any project. Regular reviews must also be done
to ensure that expectations are aligned with reality. In my experience, failing to count the costs
can lead to devastating consequences.


## The Beginning of a Project

In 2023, I embarked on a project with a non-profit organization, initially with modest expectations.
My partner, Stacie, and I each committed one day a week to develop software for them. It seemed
like a manageable project, and we had a clear plan in place with achievable milestones leading up
to the release date. But as we soon realized, things would not go as smoothly as we had hoped.


## The Unforeseen Challenges

As we delved into the project, we encountered unexpected challenges. Stacie's approach to defining
requirements led to a significant increase in the project scope, far beyond what I had initially
anticipated. By April, it became apparent that the project would demand much more time and effort
than we had budgeted for, turning it into a three-year endeavor instead of an eight-month one.


## Conflicting Perspectives

The realization of the project's true scale led to a conflict between Stacie and me. While I
believed it was necessary to adjust our plans and communicate with the organization about the
delays, Stacie insisted on sticking to the original timeline, fearing the backlash from breaking
our promises. Our inability to reach a consensus created tension and uncertainty, ultimately
leading to a breakdown in our working relationship.


## The Burden of Sacrifice

Despite my reservations, I yielded to Stacie's insistence on releasing the software by September 1,
at the cost of my mental and emotional well-being. The following months were a blur of stress, with
my professional and personal life suffering as a result. The toll of sacrificing my own needs for
the sake of the project began to take its toll on me.


## The Tragic End

Tragedy struck when Stacie fell ill and was diagnosed with cancer. The realization of her terminal
condition forced us to abandon the project and focus on her health. The relentless pursuit of
meeting project deadlines had blinded us to the cost of neglecting our own well-being. Stacie's
passing was a painful reminder of the importance of prioritizing what truly matters in life.


## Reflections on Loss

Looking back, I regret not standing my ground and advocating for a more balanced approach to the
project. The cost of not counting the true costs of our actions was incalculable, resulting in an
irreversible loss that will forever haunt me. In the end, I learned that the true price of any
endeavor goes beyond the numbers and schedulesâ€”it lies in the impact on our relationships, health,
and overall well-being.
