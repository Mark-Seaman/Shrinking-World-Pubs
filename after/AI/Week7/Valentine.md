# Valentine's Day

Today is my first Valentine's Day alone in 45 years

Remembering our extraordinary love story

20 years ago today celebrated our 25th anniversary

We hosted a big party at Christ Community Church

We invited our friends and family

We decided to renew our vows and go for another 25 years together

This event was pivotal in our relationship an acted as a public declaration of our unending love and affection.

Amid the inevitable stress of careers and family crises we felt a need to celebrate the wonderful relationship that we had together.

I've been watching the three videos that we recorded for that event.

- A slide show of each of our lives separate and together. We were 45 at the time with grown kids.   Looking at the photo brings back a flood of memories and the intense emotions that are stirred.  [Watch the Video](/family/)
- The second marriage ceremony where we decided to reup our commitment.  [Watch the Video](/family/)
- Stories about our life together. [Watch the Video](/family/)
- I wrote this poem on Valentine's Day a few years ago.  [12 Days of Valentine](/poem/Valentine.md)

These videos have become priceless to me after Stacie's loss.  Perhaps they may move you as well.
