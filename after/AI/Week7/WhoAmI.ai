# Who Am I?


I've always had a strong sense of identity.  

Five years ago I developed a model for defining my place in the world by answering a series of key questions.  
The answers reveal how a see myself and my place in the world.

1. What do I control?
2. How do I feel?
3. What do I have?
4. What are my goals?
5. Am I living in the present?
6. What do I need?
7. What will I give?

Each of these speak to some core aspect of my identity.

I have spent many hours pondering each of these areas and it has given me a great deal of clarity.

When Stacie died my old life died with her.  Most everything was tied to our life together.

I now am building a new life without her and this begins with my core identity.

Each of these questions have answers that are quite different than just a year ago.

No begins the hard work of forging a new identity as Mark Solo.

Who am I now?
