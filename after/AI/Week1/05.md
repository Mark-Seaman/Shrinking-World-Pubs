# Making Decisions

Stacie and I always made decisions together.  It was a rule we had based on the dynamics of our personalities.

I make decisions quickly (MBTI J) and Stacie makes decisions slowly (MBTI P).  

I'm a risk taker and Stacie is more risk averse.  

I find deciding easy and freeing.  I would rather make a wrong choice than none at all.

Stacie finds deciding hard and limiting.  She would rather make no choice than the wrong one.

Now I have a true delemma.  I have to make decisions on my own.  I have to make them slowly and carefully, but this is not in my nature.

Since her death, I have to many decisions. Some of these are trivial and reversable.
Others are critical and irreversible.

Fortunately, I have many people that I trust to provide the counter balance to my need for quick judgements.

There are people who I trust completely.  I will not make any large decision without gaining their approval.

I recognize that I have to make decisions and there is a potential danger is jumping to an answer without
fully weighing the consequences.  I have to make them with the knowledge that I will be held accountable for them.

This will provide a degree of safety and security to my decision making process.
