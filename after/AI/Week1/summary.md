# Day 3: Where is the Joy?

In my work as a life coach, I always pose two essential questions to my clients: What are you celebrating? and Where do you find joy? These questions are vital for our survival as we navigate through life, as it is far too easy for the challenges we face to steal away our joy. In times of trauma, finding joy becomes even more crucial for our well-being. I have come to realize that constantly striving and running in circles, trying to accomplish more, is not the ultimate goal. Life can easily be wasted in this constant pursuit, leading to deep regrets. The key is to identify where our joy truly comes from.

I have noticed that not all activities bring me joy. Some tasks drain my soul, and I actively avoid them whenever possible. On the other hand, there are activities that bring me immense joy. I believe this is true for everyone, though the specific activities may differ since we are all unique individuals. I see these soul-draining activities as weeds in a field - they sprout everywhere, unintended but inevitable. Removing them without damaging the healthy aspects is nearly impossible. Therefore, the focus should be on nurturing the activities that bring life and minimizing the ones that do not.

For a long time, I allowed social obligations to dictate my priorities, essentially becoming a "weed farmer." However, as I build my new life, I recognize that it cannot accommodate shallow relationships and activities that do not bring joy. Moving forward, I need to prune everything and prioritize what truly "sparks joy."

In my journey of self-discovery, I have identified four activities that bring me to life. These activities have always been a part of me since childhood and define who I am. They give me reasons to get up each morning. Each individual has a similar list, albeit with specific details based on their own psychology. For me, the four things that bring joy are creating, connecting, learning, and enjoying.

My perfect day ends with a sense of gratitude, celebrating a day well-lived. This celebration extends to a week, a month, a year, and ultimately, a life well-lived. But for today, I will focus on celebrating this day. As I reflect on what I have written, I hope it challenges others as it has challenged me. I want people to pause and consider, perhaps even shed a tear. When I look at my creation, I can confidently say, "it is good." I cherish the moments when I connect with someone on a deep level, discussing our hopes, dreams, and fears. Respecting each other, even when we disagree. Forgiving those who have hurt me and showing kindness to my enemies. Learning something new and fascinating, and eagerly diving deeper into it. Sharing my knowledge and gaining new insights about myself or the world around me. Being fully present and aware, acknowledging both the trauma and joy in my life. Today, I celebrate the joy and the gift of life that I have been given.
