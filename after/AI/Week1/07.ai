## Day 7: The Guest Book

It's been a week since Stacie's memorial service.  At the memorial we had a guest book to collect contact info
for people that attended.  This allows me have ongoing communication with people that were there.  Many of the people
that attended the service I had not seen for a decade or more.   What a wonderful blessing it is to be in contact once
again. I am so grateful for the people that came to the service or watched online and for the opportunity to reconnect with them.
