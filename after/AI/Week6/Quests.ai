# Four Quests

Each stage of life is defined by a set of circumstances and problems that must be solved. You can't succeed at this level until you can solve the problems that block your way. While you must face some challenges that are unique, there are problems that are universally shared at this stage of life. Being human requires us to face certain realities at common points in our development.

This problem-solving is so difficult that it becomes the defining measure of our success. Each quest consumes much of our total focus and energy during the matching stage of life. This drives our very existence and is ultimately tied to our happiness and self-worth. It is impossible to be fulfilled without completing the quest.

During our lifetime we will be challenged with four unique quests. You can't go on to the next quest without completing the prerequisite quest first. As we age we are all confronted with realities that we would like to avoid. Dysfunction sets in when we refuse to rise to the challenges that are set out by the quest.


## Belonging

The gauntlet is thrown down and must be accepted. When the quest calls we must answer. There is no good alternative. During childhood and our teen years we have the Quest for Belonging. This requires that we learn how we fit into the larger world. We must integrate all of the demands of our family, school, job training, and society to gain an understanding of how to function.

If we fail to gain this understanding then it is impossible to succeed as a young adult. Many people stumble at this first transition. They may have problems in skills, family relationships, schooling, or relating to society. These issues may follow them for years while they are trying to start a family and career. Fulfilling the Quest for Belonging allows people to get through the first major life transition.


## Success

The Young Adult years are defined by the Quest of Success. During this quest a person grapples with career and family development. It is very difficult to control and balance the multiple demands that are required to manage both a career and family. This is a painful time for most people because so much of life is out of our direct control. Success requires us to be amazingly resilient and flexible as we respond to the unexpected setbacks.

Dreams from earlier in life are put on hold because of the pressures of survival and caring for others. People during this season of life typically struggle with finding joy in daily life. Most people feel that their life is not at all what they wished for and may become quite angry or depressed. This drives the second major transition, which occurs when people reach about 40.

## Purpose

The Quest for Purpose defines the Midlife experience for ages 40-60. Many people start their midlife season by burning down the life that was built as a Young Adult in an attempt to restore lost dreams. This is always a mistake and a better answer is to make small adjustments to the existing circumstances, rather than trash the old life completely.

The Quest for Purpose seeks to add meaning to the success. This comes as a result of an understanding of my unique potential and how that should be applied to family and career. There is a deep sense of fulfillment as I realize that there are opportunities that are custom made for me. I discover that I can make a unique contribution which gives meaning and purpose to my life. This may be a time of life for discovering new dreams and recovering old ones.

## Wisdom

The final quest begins when we have found our purpose but that is no longer enough. In the final quarter of life we are driven by the Quest for Enlightenment. This builds on our success and purpose in life. But the final season requires passing on wisdom and building a legacy. Contribution is no longer fulfilling unless it results in influence. Knowing how to do things must be converted into teaching others how to do things.

This is what it looks like to finish well. A life well lived requires one to fulfill all four quests.
