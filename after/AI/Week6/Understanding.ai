Quest for Understanding

The last season of my life really started when I was around 60. Once again I was surprised by the quest. I could feel a change that was coming. It was a re-orientation away from meeting goals for others and focusing on personal achievement. in its place would be a focus on well-being and understanding the complex world I live in.

By this point in my life, I had enough financial resource to allow me not to work. With Social Security income, we would be able to live off investments until we were 90 years old.  We created a plan to be broke at 90. This allows us to live as large as possible while not running out of financial resources. We  managed our monthly budget according to this plan.

Work then became about what projects would be interesting not about making money. I had the flexibility to continue to serve others while I began investing in projects that I thought were interesting. Removing the need to make money for a tremendous freedom for both Stacie and I. She was in a very similar place in her life and had devoted time and energy to coaching publishing and mentoring others.

We were also very involved with our kids and grandkids during this time. With Stacie's passing I continue to be engaged with our kids as we process a life without her.

During this stage of life riding has become my essential activity. Most of my day is spent thinking about what to write or rewriting what I have written in the past. I've become very involved with AI and using it to write teach and develop software. Over the last year, I have hit the creative highpoint of my entire career.

Stacie's death has accelerated the learning process for me. It has caused me to think about everything more deeply. As I imagine the remaining years I am optimistic about what lies ahead. I know that there are many challenges that I must face, but looking back, gives me confidence that I will be able to overcome whatever challenges I must.
