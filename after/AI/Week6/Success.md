Quest for Success

As we become adults we realize how difficult it is to succeed.

Some choose to delay this transition and prolong their dependency on others for their well-being.

To be an adult requires taking on the burden to build a life.

Building a successful family and career is likely to consume 20 years of focused energy.

My experience as a young adult was the unending demands of balancing a career alongside parenthood and church life.

This constant juggling left me feeling depleted and unsuccessful.

even though I had external success ...

I recall feeling a sense of impending catastrophe ... house of cards.

I measured success in accomplishments, dollars, and conflicts resolved.

Stress was extreme.
