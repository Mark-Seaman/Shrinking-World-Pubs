Quest of Identity

From birth humans need love to survive.  Our entire childhood and youth are devoted to learning how to interact with others.

We learn who loves and cares for us.

We learn to recognize and trust "our people" and the mistrust and fear "outsiders".

We see some as enemies and form rules for dealing with them.

The purpose of culture is to create a group identity.

We learn that loyalty can reward us and disloyalty can punish.

We learn to balance my interests with the interests of others.

In our teen years we develop an identity  to tell us how we fit into the world.
