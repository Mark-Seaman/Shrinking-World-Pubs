# Fasting

Fasting is often seen in religious contexts as a ritualistic practice, primarily focused on the external act of
abstaining from food or certain activities. In this common view, the emphasis might be on the discipline itself as a
demonstration of piety, self-denial, or obedience. People might fast as a way to fulfill a religious obligation, hoping
to earn favor with God or to show their devotion. The focus is often on the physical act and the endurance required to
carry it out, with an underlying assumption that fasting, by its very nature, is meritorious.

In contrast, within the framework of spiritual formation as described by thinkers like Dallas Willard, fasting is
understood as a deeply transformative practice, not merely a religious obligation. It is not about earning God's favor
or proving one's spirituality but about reshaping the heart and mind. Fasting is an invitation to realign our desires
with God's will, focusing less on the physical aspect of hunger and more on spiritual nourishment. It serves as a means
to humble oneself, developing a greater sense of self-control and dependence on God. Through fasting, we become more
aware of our attachments and desires, learning to trust God more deeply when our immediate wants are not fulfilled.

This practice transforms us by cultivating a new attitude toward our desires and needs. It challenges the common
religious view that fasting is merely a way to demonstrate faith, showing instead how it can be a profound spiritual
exercise that reshapes how we live and respond to life's demands. In spiritual formation, fasting is less about the
external act and more about the internal transformation, helping us grow in our relationship with God and become more
Christlike in our attitudes and actions.
