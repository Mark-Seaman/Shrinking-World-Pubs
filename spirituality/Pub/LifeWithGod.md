# Life With God

When it comes to a life with God, there are a few key pillars that I always encourage people to
focus on. These pillars are what help us have a deep and meaningful connection with our Creator,
and they are what lead us to a life filled with purpose and joy. 

Worship is the first pillar that I want to discuss. Worship isn't just singing songs on a Sunday
morning, although that can certainly be a part of it. Worship is about trust, prayer, and even
suffering. It's about recognizing God's goodness and faithfulness, even in the midst of difficult
circumstances. It's about opening our hearts to the supernatural experiences that God wants to
reveal to us.

Community is another important pillar in a life with God. It's all about love and purpose. It's
about being a part of a church that truly embraces culture and seeks to make a positive impact in
the world. It's about avoiding the trap of seeking a cheap salvation, but rather truly embracing
the transformative power of a relationship with God.

Teaching is key when it comes to growing in our understanding of God and His ways. We must be
discerning and recognize the battle of wills that often takes place. There are false teachers out
there who will lead us astray if we're not careful. But if we ground ourselves in the truth and
allow God to shape our hearts and minds, we can navigate these challenges with wisdom.

Lastly, discipleship is all about personal growth and development. It's about allowing God to shape
our character and produce good fruit in our lives. It's about engaging in spiritual practices that
nurture our souls and transform our minds. And it's about recognizing the incredible complexities
and capabilities of the human brain, and how God can use it for His glory.

In conclusion, a life with God is rich and fulfilling. It's about worship, community, teaching, and
discipleship. It's about embracing the truth and allowing God to transform us from the inside out.
May we all prioritize these pillars in our own lives and experience the fullness of what it means
to walk with God.
