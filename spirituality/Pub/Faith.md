# Faith: Trusting in God

Our actions are a reflection of our beliefs and values, and for many, the foundation of their lives
lies in trust. Some place their trust in wealth or power, believing that these possessions will
provide them with a good life. Others believe that if they can gain control over the government,
they can secure a favorable outcome for themselves.

Personally, I desire good leaders who can serve the people. However, I also acknowledge that power
has a tendency to corrupt. As leaders gain more and more power, their desire to dominate their
enemies often follows. This is an inevitable trajectory in all human governments, as the powerful
seek to increase their power even further.

Different forms of government vary in their approach to power-sharing. Some seek to distribute the
benefits of power among many, while others concentrate it in the hands of a few. Therefore, the
quality of our society can be measured by the extent to which everyone prospers.

As God's people, we should strive to influence our leaders while recognizing that no form of
government can be fully trusted to protect everyone. We can work towards building a more equitable
world, but we must also understand that our impact is limited. Our trust in God allows us to find
contentment in the life we have and release our desire to control what is beyond our reach.
