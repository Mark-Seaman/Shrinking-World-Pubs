# Sabbath Rest

Work often is our primary source of identity and the means by which we shape the world around us. This perspective
places significant emphasis on productivity and achievement, where one's worth and sense of self are tied to what one
can accomplish. 

However, the practice of observing the Sabbath invites us to set aside this identity, regularly carving out time for
rest, worship, and reflection on God. The Sabbath is not merely a day off from work; it is a profound spiritual
discipline that allows us to step away from the relentless busyness of life and to trust in God's provision. 

Dallas Willard and Ruth Haley Barton both emphasize that the Sabbath is crucial for maintaining a healthy rhythm of work
and rest, but its transformative potential goes deeper. By observing the Sabbath, we open ourselves to receive our
identity from God, rather than from our work. This practice challenges the common religious view that equates self-worth
with productivity. Instead, it shifts our focus from what we do to who we are in God. 

As we regularly engage in this discipline, we find that our sense of self becomes more rooted in God's love and grace,
rather than in our achievements. Over time, the Sabbath reshapes our identity, teaching us to value rest and
relationship with God above the constant drive for accomplishment, ultimately leading to a more balanced and spiritually
grounded life.
