# Community

In the common religious view, community is often seen as a mere gathering of individuals for worship, teaching, and
social activities. It can sometimes be approached as a duty or obligation, something to attend regularly without
necessarily engaging deeply with others.

This perspective tends to emphasize attendance and participation in organized
events rather than fostering genuine relationships and mutual support. Community is often perceived as a place to
receive spiritual benefits rather than as a vital aspect of spiritual growth itself.

In contrast, the idea of spiritual formation as presented by Dallas Willard, Ruth Haley Barton, and Robert Mulholland
emphasizes that true discipleship cannot occur in isolation. Authentic Christian community is not just about being
present with others but engaging deeply with them in a way that provides support, encouragement, and opportunities for
mutual growth. 

This understanding of community is transformative because it shifts the focus from individual spiritual
experiences to a collective journey of becoming more like Christ. Engaging with others in this way allows for
vulnerability, accountability, and shared wisdom, which are essential for spiritual maturity.

Spiritual formation views community as an integral part of the discipleship journey, where believers help each other
navigate challenges, celebrate victories, and grow in their relationship with God. This approach recognizes that
thriving in isolation is impossible; instead, we are meant to experience spiritual growth within the context of
fellowship with other believers. 

The transformative power of this practice lies in the way it moves us from a
self-centered approach to spirituality to one that is relational and interconnected, ultimately shaping us into people
who reflect Christ's love in our interactions with others.
