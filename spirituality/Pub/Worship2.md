# Worship

Religious people view worship as a set of rituals or activities—like singing hymns, reciting prayers, or attending
services—that are performed regularly. This traditional view emphasizes the external expressions of reverence and honor
toward God, often focusing on the formal aspects of worship within a community setting. While these practices are
meaningful, they can sometimes become routine, losing their deeper significance if approached solely as religious
obligations.

In the context of spiritual formation, however, worship takes on a transformative role. It goes beyond mere ritual to
become a profound encounter with God that reshapes the worshiper's heart and mind. Dallas Willard and Ruth Haley Barton
emphasize that worship is not just about what we do, but about who we become through these practices. Worship in
spiritual formation is an intentional act of aligning one's entire being—thoughts, emotions, and actions—with the
reality of God's presence and majesty.

This approach to worship is both personal and communal. On a personal level, worship invites individuals to engage
deeply with God, to reflect on His character, and to respond in ways that foster spiritual growth and transformation. It
moves the focus from external actions to the internal work of the Holy Spirit, cultivating a heart that is more attuned
to God's will and love. On a communal level, worship brings believers together, creating a space where the collective
experience of God's presence strengthens and encourages the community, drawing each member into deeper relationship with
God and with one another.

Thus, in spiritual formation, worship is not just about giving honor to God; it is about being shaped by that honor. It
reorients our lives around God's majesty and grace, transforming us from the inside out as we continually offer
ourselves in reverence and devotion.
