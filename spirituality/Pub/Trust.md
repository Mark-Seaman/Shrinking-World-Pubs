# Unshakable Trust

Trust is an essential component of our relationship with God. It is the foundation on which our
faith is built, and it allows us to surrender our plans and desires to Him. For me, trust means
believing in God's faithfulness, letting go of control, and relying on His guidance.

Believing in God's faithfulness is not always easy. We live in a world that is full of uncertainties
and disappointments. It can be tempting to doubt the goodness of God when things don't go as
planned or when we face challenges and hardships. However, trust requires us to have faith in His
unwavering love and provision. It means believing that He is always working for our good, even when
we can't see it.

Surrendering my plans and desires is another aspect of trust. As humans, we often have our own
agendas and ideas of how things should go. But when we truly trust God, we are willing to let go of
our plans and allow Him to direct our steps. It requires a willingness to lay down our own will and
submit to His perfect plan for our lives.

Letting go of control can be a difficult task, especially for those of us who like to be in charge.
Trusting in God means acknowledging that He is in control and that His ways are higher than our
ways. It means surrendering the need to have all the answers and trusting that He will guide us in
the right direction.

Relying on God's guidance is the final piece of the puzzle. Trusting God means relying on Him for
wisdom and guidance in making decisions. It means seeking His will and asking for His direction in
every aspect of our lives. Trust requires us to quiet our own agenda and listen for His voice,
knowing that He will never lead us astray.

Trust is the bedrock of our relationship with God. It is a choice to believe in His faithfulness,
surrender our plans and desires, let go of control, and rely on His guidance. Trusting God is not
always easy, but it is a necessary step in cultivating a deep and meaningful relationship with Him.
So I encourage you to take that leap of faith and experience the immeasurable peace and joy that
comes from trusting in a faithful and loving God.
