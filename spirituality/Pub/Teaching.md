# Teaching

Teaching is a crucial part of my life with God. It is not just about acquiring knowledge or filling
my head with information. Teaching is about learning to think and live like Jesus, embodying His
truth and love in every aspect of my life.

The nature of truth is something I have wrestled with for many years. In a world that values
relativism and personal opinions, it can be challenging to hold fast to the absolute truth of God's
word. But I have found that the more I dive into Scripture and seek understanding, the more I am
convinced of its truth and relevance for my life.

The battle of wills is a constant struggle in my journey with God. It is a daily choice to surrender
my own desires and submit to His will. It is not always easy, but I have seen the beauty and
freedom that comes from aligning my will with His. It is in the surrender that I find true
fulfillment and purpose.

False teachers are a reality in the world today. It is crucial to exercise discernment and test
everything against the truth of Scripture. False teaching can be subtle and enticing, but it leads
to destruction and bondage. As followers of Jesus, we must be vigilant and discerning, holding fast
to the truth and protecting ourselves and others from deception.

Discernment is a skill that can be cultivated through prayer, study, and the guidance of the Holy
Spirit. It is theability to distinguish between what is true and what is false, what is of God and
what is of the world. Discernment requires humility and a willingness to be corrected and
challenged. It is not about being judgmental or critical, but about seeking wisdom and
understanding.
