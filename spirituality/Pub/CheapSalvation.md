# Cheap Salvation

Our cultural understanding is that God serves us. It is common for people to view God as
someone who exists solely to fulfill our desires and bring us happiness. We often approach God with
a consumer mindset, seeking to get what we want from him without any commitment or sacrifice on our
part. This flawed understanding of God's role in our lives has led to a cheapened concept of
salvation.

True salvation, however, requires a complete surrender of our own desires and ambitions. It is not a
transaction where we simply exchange our sins for a ticket to heaven. Instead, it is a
transformative process that requires us to die to ourselves and live for God. Jesus said, "Whoever
wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it"
(Matthew 16:25).

Following Jesus is not easy. It is not a popular path in our culture that prioritizes
self-gratification and the pursuit of personal happiness. Jesus himself described it as the narrow
road (Matthew 7:13-14). It requires discipline, sacrifice, and a willingness to break with
cultural norms. However, it is on this narrow road that we find true life and a deep, satisfying
relationship with God.

God is not just a means to satisfy our desires; He is the rightful King of our lives. As his
subjects, we owe him our allegiance, obedience, and devotion. It is only when we acknowledge and
embrace His lordship that we experience the fullness of life and purpose that he intended for us.

Salvation is not a cheap ticket to paradise; it is a radical call to a new way of life. It requires
us to let go of our self-centered desires and embrace a life of surrender and obedience to our
King. This road may be narrow, but it is the only path that leads to abundant life and true
fulfillment.
