# The Truth Hurts

We all have natural blind spots that can hinder our ability to discern the truth. Our biases,
preconceived notions, and personal experiences shape our perspectives and can cloud our judgment.
These blind spots can prevent us from seeing alternative viewpoints and considering new ideas. It
is important for us to acknowledge and address these blind spots, to actively seek out diverse
perspectives, and to engage in thoughtful and open-minded dialogue. 

Sound teaching helps uncover these blind spots, challenging us to critically evaluate our own
beliefs and assumptions, and encouraging us to expand our understanding of the world. Through
self-reflection and a willingness to learn and grow, we can overcome these blind spots and become
more discerning individuals.

Accepting the truth can be a painful process. If an idea or belief goes against our natural
inclination or challenges our existing beliefs, we tend to reject it by default. We are creatures
of comfort, seeking stability and familiarity. However, growth and transformation require us to
question our assumptions and embrace the discomfort that comes with facing the truth.

Learning to ignore the negative reaction that arises when confronted with a painful truth allows our
rational brain to work. It compels us to critically evaluate the evidence and consider alternative
perspectives. Personal growth and intellectual development require us to let go of our ego and be
willing to change our minds when presented with compelling evidence or sound reasoning.
