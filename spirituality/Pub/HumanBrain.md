# The Human Brain

The human brain is a remarkable organ that governs our cognitive functions, emotions, and behaviors.
It is the control center of our thoughts and actions, allowing us to think, feel, perceive, reason,
and make decisions. Our thoughts and emotions play a significant role in shaping our overall
well-being and the choices we make in life.

Emotional health is closely tied to the workings of our brain. The brain processes and interprets
emotions, influencing how we experience and respond to the world around us. It affects our mood,
attitude, and ability to empathize with others. Understanding and nurturing our emotional health is
essential for maintaining a balanced and fulfilling life.

Our spiritual maturity will never go beyond our emotional maturity.  If we are not emotionally 
healthy then we can not be spiritually healthy either.  How we deal with relationshihps, past hurts,
and trauma
in life is foundational to our journey as disciples.

Both genetics and the environment play key roles in shaping the development and functioning of the
brain. Our genetics determine the basic structure of our brain, while environmental factors such as
our upbringing, experiences, and relationships influence how our brain circuits are wired. This
interplay between nature and nurture highlights the complexity of human beings and the need for
holistic approaches to life and discipleship.

As a proponent of discipleship, I believe that the road to true discipleship starts in the brain.
Our thoughts and beliefs shape our actions and ultimately define the trajectory of our lives. By
renewing our minds and aligning our thoughts with the teachings of love, humility, and
selflessness, we can embark on a transformative journey of discipleship.

To truly follow the path of discipleship, we must understand that our brains are not just vessels
for processing information but places of spiritual formation. Our thoughts and emotions are deeply
connected to our spiritual well-being, and by cultivating a positive and compassionate mindset, we
can grow closer to God and live out His teachings.
