# Love: Building Connection

Every one of us has a fundamental need to feel loved. Our biology is wired to require love and
connection. In society, whether it be within a family, tribe, nation, company, school, church,
religion, or culture, we create a strong sense of identity. This identity builds a connection
between us that can either be profoundly nurturing and life-giving or entirely destructive.

Every social community fosters an "us vs. them" mentality. We establish rules and boundaries to
separate "us" from "them." We learn to trust "us" and fear "them." Even within families, schools,
companies, and states, this dynamic persists.

When nations go to war, their leaders systematically demonize the enemy to justify the act of
killing them as a means to create a better world. Unfortunately, this dynamic is present at all
levels of community.

Loving our own community is undoubtedly important, but hating others is clearly against the will of
God. It does not matter whether the person spreading hate is a religious or political leader; their
words do not align with the voice of God. True leaders guided by God will always advocate for love
and compassion towards others, regardless of who they are.
