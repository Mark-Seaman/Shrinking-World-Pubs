# Community

I firmly believe that we were not meant to walk this journey alone. God designed us for community, for relationships that are rooted in love and built on mutual support and encouragement. The church is the embodiment of that community, a place where we can come together to worship, learn, and grow together.

Love is at the core of community. It is not just a feeling or an emotion, but a choice to put others before ourselves. Love is patient, kind, and sacrificial. It is the glue that holds us together and the driving force behind everything we do. Without love, our community would be empty and meaningless.

The purpose of the church is not just to meet on Sundays and listen to a sermon. It is so much more than that. The church is a place where we can serve one another, bear each other's burdens, and spur one another on toward love and good deeds. It is a community of believers who are committed to following Jesus and making His love known to the world.

Embracing culture is an important aspect of community. We are called to be in the world but not of the world. This means engaging with the world around us, understanding its needs and struggles, and bringing God's love and truth into every aspect of society. The church should be a beacon of light in a dark world, offering hope and healing to all.

Cheap salvation is not what Jesus offers. Salvation is not just a ticket to heaven, but a transformation of heart and mind. It is a lifelong journey of surrender and growth. The church should not settle for easy answers or quick fixes. We should be willing to dive deep into the complexities of life and wrestle with the tough questions in order to truly understand and experience the depth of God's love and grace.
