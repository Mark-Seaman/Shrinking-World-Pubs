# Worship

Worship is at the heart of my life with God. It is not just about singing hymns or attending church
services, although those can be wonderful expressions of worship. Worship is about surrendering to
God and recognizing His greatness. It is about acknowledging His sovereignty and seeking His
presence in every aspect of my life.

Trust is a vital component of worship. It is believing that God is who He says He is and that He can
do what He says He can do. Trusting God means letting go of my own agenda and resting in His
perfect plan for my life. It is a daily surrender to His will and a confident assurance that He is
faithful.

Prayer is another essential element of worship. It is not just a religious duty or a means to get
what I want. Prayer is about cultivating a relationship with God and seeking His guidance and
wisdom. It is both a conversation and a time of solitude, where I can pour out my heart to Him and
listen for His gentle voice.

Suffering is an inevitable part of life, but it can also deepen my worship. In the midst of pain and
hardship, I have found a deeper dependence on God and a greater appreciation for His love and
grace. Suffering reminds me of my need for Him and draws me closer to His heart. It is in the
darkest moments that my worship shines the brightest.

Supernatural experiences are not the foundation of my faith, but they are a beautiful part of my
journey with God. I have witnessed healings, seen miracles, and experienced His presence in a
tangible way. These encounters with the supernatural remind me that there is more to this life than
what I can see and touch. They affirm my faith and deepen my worship.
