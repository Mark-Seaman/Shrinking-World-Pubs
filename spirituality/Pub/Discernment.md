# Discernment

As a firm believer in the interconnectedness of all people, I hold the belief that anyone can hear
from God. It is not solely reserved for a select few or religious leaders. God speaks to us
collectively, not individually, and it is our natural tendency to seek His guidance in our lives.

While we all have the capacity to hear from God, the way we perceive his message differs from person
to person. Each of us has unique areas of insight and blind spots, shaped by our genetics and
environment. Our specific sensitivities and biases play a significant role in shaping our awareness
of God's voice.

It is important to recognize that we all have the mind of God, equipped with specific body parts
that enable us to navigate the world. However, it can be challenging to hear the voices of people
who are unlike us, as we tend to gravitate towards those who share our perspectives. Yet, it is
precisely these differences that are essential for us to gain a complete understanding of God's
intentions.

Within the church community, we can find five distinct voices of church leaders: the apostle,
prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. Each of these voices brings forth a unique perspective on
God's message. The apostle offers a vision of God's kingdom, while the prophet speaks truth to
power. The evangelist spreads the gospel, and the pastor provides care and guidance to the flock.
Finally, the teacher imparts knowledge and understanding.

To truly understand God's voice, we must be open and receptive to all these voices within the
church. Only through embracing each voice can we gain a more holistic understanding of God's
intentions for us. It is through this collective discernment that we can navigate the complexities
of life and follow God's calling for us.
