God's kingdom is dramatically different than the human way.  Many view this as a subtle distinction that requires a great deal of discernment.  I view the separation between human ways and God's ways as blatantly obvious.  This article is intended to highlight the key differences between kingdoms.

The human way is characterized by having power over others.  All governments operate on the dynamics of control.
The power to control begins subtle at first but is always based on the threat of violence.  Law breakers are punished
Sometimes this is wielded for the common good but it is always used to protect those who control the power.

The primary characteristics of God's way stands in marked contrast to the human way of control.


Humility


Pride is at the root of our humanity. Every person not only wants to get their way but is also driven to dominate others. We band together as families, tribes, and nations to help our group achieve power over others.  Violence permeates every aspect of our societies as a result.

Our lack of humility fuels the desire to win at the expense of others.  This makes us prone to being manipulated by fear to do evil things while calling them good.  Wanting to protect US we attack THEM.

We do not set out to do evil.   We do, however what to get our way and protect our way of life.  We are willing to do evil deeds with the belief that the ends will justify the means.  Even the most horrific acts in history were promoted as just wars to create a better world.


Faith


Our actions are determined by our beliefs and values. Our trust will determine how we live our lives.  Some trust in money or power to make their lives worth living.  Some believe that if we could control the government that we would be able to have good life.

I desire to be served by good leaders but also acknowledge that power corrupts.  As leader have more extreme power granted to them their desire to dominate their enemies inevitably follows.  All humans government will eventually be controlled by the powerful to increase their power.

Some forms of government seek to share the benefits of power with many while others seek to benefit a very few.  Therefore the goodness of our society can largely be measured by the degree to which everyone prospers.  

God's people should seek to influence the leaders while recognizing that we can't fully trust any form of government to protect all.  We try to build a more equitable world.  Yet we understand that our impact is quite limited.  Our trust in God lets us enjoy the life we live and release the desire to control what we can't.


Hope


Hope is believing that there is a better life available to us.  We all fear that the future is a place of pain and misery.  The news and social media are conduits of fear to manipulate our emotions.  Some have learned to weaponize these channels to accomplish their goals by playing to fear.

We are all prone to both conscious manipulation and incidental tendencies to imagine to worst.  We must guard against the call to fear.  We need to become aware of the impact of what we expose our minds to.  It is important for us to develop a personal policy for the information that we consume.

Our mental and emotional health are largely determined by what we believe.  Our biology makes us prone to believe the worst and live in a state of perpetual threat response.  Religious and political leaders have learned how to use our fear to control the masses to accomplish their goals. Beware of this dynamic and oppose it.


Love


Each of us need to feel loved.  We are biologically created to require love.  All society (family, tribe, nation, company, school, church, religion, culture) defines a strong sense of identity.  This creates a connection between us that can be profoundly nurishing (and life-giving) or entirely destructive.

Every form of social community creates an identity of US (my people) and THEM (those people).  We develop rules to separate US from THEM.  We learn to trust US and fear THEM.

When nations go to war the leaders systematically demonize THEM to show how killing THEM is making the world better.  This dynamic occurs at every level of community from families, schools, companies, and states.

Loving US is truly important but hating THEM is clearly demonic. Whenever we hear hate speak out we know that it is not the voice of God.  It doesn't matter is the person is recognized as a religious or political leader.  Godly leaders are always in favor of loving THEM.
