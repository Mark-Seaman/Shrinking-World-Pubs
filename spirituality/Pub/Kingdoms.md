# God's Kingdom vs. Human Ways

As someone who has dedicated my life to teaching about discipleship and the path to following God, I
feel it is important to highlight the profound differences between the ways of God's kingdom and
the ways of humans. While some may view these differences as subtle and requiring great
discernment, I believe that the separation between the two is blatantly obvious. In this article, I
aim to shed light on these key differences and help us understand how we can embrace God's way in
our own lives.

The differences between God's way and the human way are fundamental and stark. By recognizing and
understanding these differences, we can strive to align our lives more closely with God's kingdom.
Embracing humility, placing our trust in God, fostering hope, and practicing love are central to
living out God's way in our own lives. It is my hope that through this understanding, we can all
work towards creating a world that reflects the values and principles of God's kingdom.

As humans we have a desire to make others believe that we are acting under God's authority when we
are really seeking to assert our own wills.  We seek to power over others and will not hesitate
to use violence to gain control.  This starts subtly at first but if left unchecked will produce
bloodshed in God's name.

One of the defining characteristics of the human way is the desire for power and control over
others. We see this in all aspects of our societies, especially in the operations of governments.
While this power may start off subtle, it is ultimately based on the threat of violence and the
punishment of lawbreakers. The intention behind this control may be to serve the common good, but
it often ends up protecting the interests of those in power.
