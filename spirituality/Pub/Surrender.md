# Prayer of Surrender

I acknowledge your right to have complete authority in my life.

I also admit my tendency to try and take back control for myself.

Make me aware of when I am being disobedient to your will.

Show me when I am not taking responsibility for what I Do, Say, Think, and Feel.

Teach me to avoid trying to control what others Do, Say, Think, and Feel.

I often want to get my own way and seek to justify it by calling it your way.

I am prone to deception in every area of my life.

I trust you - help me in my mistrust.

I yield to you - help me in my resistance.

Work in my life to produce your fruit: 

- Love, Joy, Peace
- Patience, Kindness, Goodness
- Faithfulness, Gentleness, Self-control

Transform my emotions to align with your will

- for Anger bring Humility
- for Fear bring Faith
- for Sadness bring Hope
- for Shame bring Love

Transform my public and private life

- in Work
- in Relationships
- in Play
- in Growth

Transform my goals and expectations

- what I expose my mind to
- how I relate to others
- what I love
- what I commit to

Teach me to focus on what I can do rather than on what I can't do.

Let me focus on what I contribute rather than the reward I desire.

Let me live in the current reality and free me from the hurts of past and the fear of the future.

Let me be quick to forgive and patient with others.

Free me from criticism and judgemental attitudes.

May I extend grace to others.

Let peace control my emotions and remove the anxiety that darkens my thoughts.

Help me to accept both my capabilities and limitations with humility.

Build resilence into me by fully trusting you.

Show me when I am wrong and help me to apologize quickly.

Teach me to use each opportunity and resources wisely for the maximum benefit.

Show the balance between seeking my own good and that of others.

Help me to defuse rather than escalate conflict.

Teach me how to be blissfully detached from my surroundings.
