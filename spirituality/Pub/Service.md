# Service

Service is commonly understood as fulfilling a duty or obligation, where the focus is on completing
tasks or meeting the needs of others as a form of good works. This perspective may emphasize the importance of helping
others, but it can sometimes lead to a transactional mindset, where service is performed out of a sense of requirement
or to earn favor with God or others.

In contrast, the concept of service within spiritual formation goes much deeper. It is not just about what we do, but
about who we are becoming in the process. Robert Mulholland, for example, emphasizes that service is about embodying
Christ's love in a way that is transformative both for the one serving and for those being served. This form of service
is not driven by obligation but by a genuine desire to reflect Christ's love. 

When approached as a spiritual discipline, service becomes a way to participate in God's work in the world, fostering
humility, compassion, and a deeper connection with others. This active love, expressed through service, has the power to
transform our lives by drawing us closer to the heart of God and aligning our actions with His purposes. It also
transforms the lives of others, not merely by meeting their needs, but by revealing the love and grace of Christ through
our actions.
