# God's Way Humility

In stark contrast to the forceful human methods, God's way is characterized by humility. Our human nature is fueled by pride,
causing us to not only want to get our own way but also to dominate others. We form groups, whether
it be families, tribes, or nations, with the aim of achieving power over others. Sadly, violence
becomes a pervasive part of our societies as a result.

Our lack of humility feeds our desire to win at the expense of others. This makes us susceptible to
manipulation and allows us to do evil things while convincing ourselves that they are good. In our
quest to protect our own interests, we often attack and vilify those we perceive as threats.

It is important to recognize that while we may not set out to do evil, our desire to get our way and
preserve our way of life can lead us to justify the means by the ends. This justification has been
used throughout history to promote even the most horrific acts as just wars aimed at creating a
better world.
