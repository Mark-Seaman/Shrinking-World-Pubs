# Discerning the True and False

Truth is not always obvious. In today's society, we are bombarded with information from various
sources, making it challenging to discern what is true and what is false. Moreover, our own biases
and preconceived notions can cloud our judgment, leading to self-deception. Therefore, we need
sound teaching to guide us in distinguishing fact from fiction, reality from illusion.

Lies have the power to control how people think and behave. They manipulate our emotions, instill
fear, and foster division. Extremism thrives on exploiting these vulnerabilities, further fuelling
discord and conflict. Sound teaching equips us with the tools to recognize these manipulations,
challenging us to critically evaluate the information presented to us, and enabling us to make
informed decisions based on truth and rationality.

Religious and political leaders often use lies to control others and incite extremism.
Unfortunately, throughout history, there have been instances where individuals in positions of
power have manipulated the truth to further their own agendas. They have exploited people's trust
and faith, distorting their beliefs and inciting division and conflict. 

These leaders take advantage of the natural human inclination to seek guidance and direction, using
lies and propaganda to control the minds and hearts of their followers. The consequences of such
manipulation can be devastating, leading to wars, genocide, and the erosion of basic human rights.
It is crucial for us to recognize and challenge these tactics, to seek truth and discernment
independently, rather than blindly following the words of those in authority.
