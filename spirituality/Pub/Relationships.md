# Spiritual Relationships

In the midst of the individualistic society we live in, it is important to remember that as human
beings, we are not meant to be isolated. We were created for relationships. And when it comes to
spirituality, true growth and transformation can only happen when we live in community with
others.

For me, spiritual relationships can be divided into multiple spheres of influence. Each of these
spheres play a vital role in our spiritual growth and development.

Our families are the primary source of love, support, and understanding. They provide a safe space
for us to learn, grow, and be nurtured. Our families are the first community we experience and they
shape our understanding of relationships from a young age.  Family is not limited to blood
relatives but those with whom you share a deep mutual commitment. It includes those you will love
10 years from now.

The church is a community of people who seek God together. This is where we learn to worship, and
encourage one another. It is within the church community that we find accountability, spiritual
guidance, and deeper connections with God and others.

We are called to engage the culture around us. This means being present in our local communities,
schools, and work and making a positive impact. We must not conform to the culture or be at war
with it, but rather seek to bring truth and love wherever we go. Through our actions and words, we
can make the world a better place.

In a time where individualism and self-isolation are increasingly valued, it is important to
remember the power and importance of spiritual relationships. It is within these relationships that
we find strength, support, and love. So, let us embrace the call to live in community, as we
journey together towards spiritual growth and transformation.
