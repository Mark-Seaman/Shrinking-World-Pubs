# Community

Community is at the heart of everything I believe. Without love and connection to others, we are
left empty and alone. Love is not just a feeling, but a way of living. It is the true test of our
maturity and character. 

Loving others, even our enemies, is the standard that Jesus set for us. It is not easy, I know. But
it is what sets us apart and allows us to truly reflect the love of God. We are called to always
improve, to grow in love, but we must remember that we never truly arrive. It is a lifelong
journey.

The purpose of the church is to be a community of believers, a spiritual family. We are all broken
people seeking God and finding healing in our relationships with one another. It is through our
connections and shared experiences that we can grow and support one another in our faith.

Embracing culture is another important aspect of our faith. Culture defines who we are and it is our
responsibility to reveal God's truth through it. Every culture has its beauty and ugliness, and it
is our role as followers of Jesus to bring redemption and restoration to every aspect of our
world.

I must caution against the idea of cheap salvation. Many in our culture believe that God exists to
serve our desires, but this is far from the truth. To truly follow Jesus means to lose our lives,
to surrender our own desires and ambitions, in order to gain a life with God. It is the narrow
road, the road of obedience. We must remember that the King has a right to rule, and our ultimate
purpose is to live in submission to His loving leadership. 

Community, love, embracing culture, and rejecting cheap salvation are all essential
to following God wholeheartedly. May we continue to seek His ways and grow in our understanding of
what it means to live as His disciples in this world.
