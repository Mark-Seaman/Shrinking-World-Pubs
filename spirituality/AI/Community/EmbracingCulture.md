# Embracing Culture

Culture defines who we are. It shapes our beliefs, values, and behaviors. It is the lens through which we see the world and make sense of our experiences. And as a disciple of Jesus, I believe that culture can also reveal God's truth.

Every culture has its own unique beauty and ugliness. There are aspects of culture that reflect the goodness and creativity of God. These can be seen in the arts, language, traditions, and customs. The beauty in culture resonates with the deep longing we all have for something greater than ourselves. It points us to the existence of a loving and creative God.

However, culture is not perfect. It also reflects the brokenness and fallenness of humanity. It can be influenced by greed, injustice, and other negative forces. It is important for us to acknowledge and critique these aspects of culture, while still appreciating the elements that are good and true.

This is where Jesus comes in. He came to redeem and restore all of creation, including culture. Through his life, death, and resurrection, he offers hope and transformation to both individuals and communities. As disciples of Jesus, we are called to embrace and engage with culture in a way that reflects the values of the Kingdom of God.

This means being actively involved in our communities, seeking to bring healing and reconciliation where there is brokenness. It means using our gifts, talents, and resources to create and contribute to culture in ways that honor and reflect God's truth and grace. It means being open to learning from and celebrating the diversity of cultures around us.

As we embrace culture, may we do so with humility, discernment, and love. And may we always remember that our ultimate identity and allegiance is found in Christ, who has called us to be his disciples in and through the culture of our time.
