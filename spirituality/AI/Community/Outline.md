# Community

## Love
### If you don't have love you have nothing
### Love is the true test of maturity
### Loving enemies is the standard
### We always improve but never arrive
 
## Purpose of Church
### Community of believers
### Broken people seeking God
### Spiritual Family
### Relationships and healing

## Embracing Culture
### Culture defines who we are
### Reveal God's truth 
### All culture has beauty and ugliness
### Jesus came to redeem and restore

## Cheap Salvation
### The cultural understanding is that God serves our desires
### Lose your life to gain a life with God
### This is the narrow road
### King has a right to rule
