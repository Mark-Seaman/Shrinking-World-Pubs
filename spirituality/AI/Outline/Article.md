# Life With God

### Worship

Worship is at the heart of my life with God. It is not just about singing hymns or attending church services, although those can be wonderful expressions of worship. Worship is about surrendering to God and recognizing His greatness. It is about acknowledging His sovereignty and seeking His presence in every aspect of my life.

Trust is a vital component of worship. It is believing that God is who He says He is and that He can do what He says He can do. Trusting God means letting go of my own agenda and resting in His perfect plan for my life. It is a daily surrender to His will and a confident assurance that He is faithful.

Prayer is another essential element of worship. It is not just a religious duty or a means to get what I want. Prayer is about cultivating a relationship with God and seeking His guidance and wisdom. It is both a conversation and a time of solitude, where I can pour out my heart to Him and listen for His gentle voice.

Suffering is an inevitable part of life, but it can also deepen my worship. In the midst of pain and hardship, I have found a deeper dependence on God and a greater appreciation for His love and grace. Suffering reminds me of my need for Him and draws me closer to His heart. It is in the darkest moments that my worship shines the brightest.

Supernatural experiences are not the foundation of my faith, but they are a beautiful part of my journey with God. I have witnessed healings, seen miracles, and experienced His presence in a tangible way. These encounters with the supernatural remind me that there is more to this life than what I can see and touch. They affirm my faith and deepen my worship.

### Community

I firmly believe that we were not meant to walk this journey alone. God designed us for community, for relationships that are rooted in love and built on mutual support and encouragement. The church is the embodiment of that community, a place where we can come together to worship, learn, and grow together.

Love is at the core of community. It is not just a feeling or an emotion, but a choice to put others before ourselves. Love is patient, kind, and sacrificial. It is the glue that holds us together and the driving force behind everything we do. Without love, our community would be empty and meaningless.

The purpose of the church is not just to meet on Sundays and listen to a sermon. It is so much more than that. The church is a place where we can serve one another, bear each other's burdens, and spur one another on toward love and good deeds. It is a community of believers who are committed to following Jesus and making His love known to the world.

Embracing culture is an important aspect of community. We are called to be in the world but not of the world. This means engaging with the world around us, understanding its needs and struggles, and bringing God's love and truth into every aspect of society. The church should be a beacon of light in a dark world, offering hope and healing to all.

Cheap salvation is not what Jesus offers. Salvation is not just a ticket to heaven, but a transformation of heart and mind. It is a lifelong journey of surrender and growth. The church should not settle for easy answers or quick fixes. We should be willing to dive deep into the complexities of life and wrestle with the tough questions in order to truly understand and experience the depth of God's love and grace.

### Teaching

Teaching is a crucial part of my life with God. It is not just about acquiring knowledge or filling my head with information. Teaching is about learning to think and live like Jesus, embodying His truth and love in every aspect of my life.

The nature of truth is something I have wrestled with for many years. In a world that values relativism and personal opinions, it can be challenging to hold fast to the absolute truth of God's word. But I have found that the more I dive into Scripture and seek understanding, the more I am convinced of its truth and relevance for my life.

The battle of wills is a constant struggle in my journey with God. It is a daily choice to surrender my own desires and submit to His will. It is not always easy, but I have seen the beauty and freedom that comes from aligning my will with His. It is in the surrender that I find true fulfillment and purpose.

False teachers are a reality in the world today. It is crucial to exercise discernment and test everything against the truth of Scripture. False teaching can be subtle and enticing, but it leads to destruction and bondage. As followers of Jesus, we must be vigilant and discerning, holding fast to the truth and protecting ourselves and others from deception.

Discernment is a skill that can be cultivated through prayer, study, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is theability to distinguish between what is true and what is false, what is of God and what is of the world. Discernment requires humility and a willingness to be corrected and challenged. It is not about being judgmental or critical, but about seeking wisdom and understanding.

### Discipleship

Discipleship is the heart of my life with God. It is about becoming more like Jesus in character and action. It is a lifelong journey of growth and transformation, where the Holy Spirit works within me to shape me into the person God created me to be.

Character development is a key component of discipleship. It is not just about having the right beliefs or following a set of rules. Character is about who I am at the core, my values, attitudes, and actions. It is about embodying the fruit of the Spirit - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

Personal fruit is another outcome of discipleship. As I grow in my relationship with God, I see the evidence of His work in my life. I experience His peace in the midst of chaos, His joy in the midst of sorrow, and His love in the midst of brokenness. The fruit of the Spirit is not something I can produce on my own, but it is the result of abiding in Christ and allowing His life to flow through me.

Spiritual practices are tools that help me deepen my relationship with God and grow in my discipleship. These practices, such as prayer, meditation, fasting, and solitude, provide opportunities for me to encounter God in a deeper way. They help me align my heart and mind with His and cultivate a greater intimacy with Him.

The human brain is a fascinating aspect of discipleship. God has designed us with the capacity to learn, to reason, and to make choices. Understanding how our brains work can help us navigate the challenges of discipleship and make informed decisions. It is important to renew our minds with the truth of God's word and to continually seek understanding and wisdom.

In conclusion, life with God is a journey of worship, community, teaching, and discipleship. It is not always easy, but it is filled with joy, peace, and purpose. It is a life of surrender, growth, and transformation. I am grateful for the opportunity to walk this journey with God, and I am excited to see where He leads me next.
