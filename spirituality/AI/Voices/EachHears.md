# Every person hears from God

Every person hears from God. This may seem like a bold statement to make, but let me explain. When I
say that every person hears from God, I don't mean that God literally speaks audibly to every
individual. Rather, I mean that collectively, as human beings, we have the capacity to discern the
promptings and insights that God gently places in our hearts.

It is a natural tendency for us as human beings to seek a connection with something greater than
ourselves. Whether we recognize it or not, we are all on a spiritual journey, searching for meaning
and purpose in life. And in that search, we often find ourselves receiving specific insights
or "nudges" from God.

These specific insights can come in various forms. It could be a sudden realization or a deep
intuition that guides us in a certain direction. It could be a word of encouragement or a sense of
peace in the midst of turmoil. It could even be a divine appointment or a chance encounter that
profoundly impacts our lives.

However, it is important to note that these individual insights do not provide us with a complete
picture of reality. Our understanding is limited, and we must be humble and open-minded enough to
acknowledge that. God's ways are higher than our ways, and His thoughts are higher than our
thoughts.

Therefore, it is wise to seek guidance and discernment from others who are on the same spiritual
journey. By engaging in thoughtful conversations, sharing our experiences, and learning from one
another, we can gain a broader perspective and a deeper understanding of God's will.

So, yes, every person hears from God, but it is through collective insights and the wisdom of others
that we can begin to piece together a fuller understanding of His plan for our lives. May we always
be open to hearing God's voice, both individually and collectively, and may we seek the insights of
others to deepen our understanding of His ways.
