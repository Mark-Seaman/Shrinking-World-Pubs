# Micropub Product Deliverables

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of micropublishing is the ability to work on information that
can be published at several different levels of detail.  Publishing content begins with constructing
the full information network for the body of knowledge.  Imagine building a web from the set of pages in 
a book by finding all of the related interconnections.  

From this info web a set of products can be created at the desired level of detail.  This can range
from a book to a single message. The same information can be published at very different levels of
granularity.


## Payloads

There are several levels of publishing payloads that are composed by nesting them together.  Each
level holds roughly four times the content of the previous level.   Live lectures, videos, and written
materials all can be represented in these payloads.  

- Message  - 50 words - 1 min video
- Post     - 1 page   - 5 min video
- Article  - 5 pages  - 20 min video
- Micropub - 20 pages - 1 hour video
