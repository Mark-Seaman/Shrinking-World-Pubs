# Micropub Product Deliverables
  
Publishing payloads are an essential component of micropublishing, allowing authors to create
content at different levels of detail and granularity to suit their audience's preferences. A
payload refers to the amount of content that is delivered in a specific format or medium, such as a
message, post, article, micropub, minipub, or fullpub. Each payload has a varying level of detail,
length, and complexity, which can be nested together to provide readers with access to different
levels of information.

The idea of publishing payloads is based on the premise that different readers have different needs
and preferences when it comes to consuming content. Some readers may prefer short and concise
messages or posts that they can quickly read or watch, while others may prefer more in-depth
articles or publications that provide a detailed analysis of a particular topic.

By providing a range of publishing payloads, authors can cater to the diverse needs and preferences
of their audience. They can start by creating a full information network for their body of
knowledge, which serves as the foundation for all their content. From this information web, authors
can then create different payloads at the desired level of detail and granularity.

The smallest payload is the message, which typically consists of 50 words or less and can be
delivered in the form of a one-minute video. Messages are ideal for conveying short and concise
information or for engaging readers quickly. Posts, on the other hand, are slightly longer and
typically consist of one page of content or a five-minute video. Posts are ideal for providing
readers with a more detailed analysis of a particular topic or for sharing personal experiences.

Articles are more in-depth and typically consist of five pages of content or a 20-minute video.
Articles are ideal for providing readers with a comprehensive overview of a particular topic or for
exploring a topic in greater depth. Micropubs and minipubs are even more detailed and typically
consist of 20 and 80 pages of content, respectively. These payloads are ideal for providing readers
with an in-depth analysis of a particular topic or for exploring a topic in greater detail.

Finally, fullpubs are the most detailed and comprehensive payloads, consisting of 320 pages of
content or a 20-hour video. Fullpubs are ideal for providing readers with a complete overview of a
particular topic or for exploring a topic in great depth.

In conclusion, publishing payloads are an essential component of micropublishing, allowing authors
to create content at different levels of detail and granularity to suit the diverse needs and
preferences of their audience. By providing a range of payloads, authors can engage readers at
different levels of detail and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of a particular
topic or subject.
