# Genetics Textbook Project


## Project

This project is an experiment to use AI in a human partnership to create
a draft of a textbook in a day.
This resulted in enormous learning for everyone involved.

This project is a partnership between two humans and an AI.  Chat-GPT was used extensively in
many ways to create content, edit writing, and do research.


## Goals

* Make a good start on a textbook for teaching Genetics to high school students
* Create a workflow for interacting with Chat-GPT
* Create a library of Chat-GPT prompts and techniques
* Produce both quality and quantity
* Teach others from our experience


## Video - Writing a textbook with AI

We recorded a video to discuss the project itself and to explore the idea of using an AI
to assist in the entire project.


## Github Repo

* Public Repo - https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/Shrinking-World-Pubs
This public git repo contains all of the chat-GPT prompts and the final output after extensive editing.
This repo will be updated as we have time and energy to work on it.
Additional contributors are welcome.


### Text Book Pages
* Pages can be viewed through the Shrinking World Pubs website at 
[https://seamansguide.com/genetics](https://seamansguide.com/genetics)
* The content of this repo is displayed Shrinking World Publishing platform.
* The app is written in Django and hosted at Digital Ocean.
* The Genetics textbook is one of many pubs that will be produced.

### Chet Requests

* Content creation begins by making requests to our artificial author
partner, Chet Gupta (aka chatGPT).
* These requests are entered into chatGPT.
* The requests are stored in this directory as individual files to
give us an audit trail for the design process.

### Chet Responses

* Chet is producing lots of output in response to each request. The
output is stored for each of the requests.
* Some of these requests will be used as the best answer for one segment
of the book.
* Hand edited content is created as files in the directory 
"Shrinking-World-Pubs/Genetics/Book"
