# Learning to Teach

As a teacher, I adopted the posture of a learner. Everything I did was viewed as an experiment. The things that worked, I standardized and what didn't work was never repeated. Over a brief time, this yielded practical methods for teaching students the skills they need. This constant improvement paradigm is thoroughly ingrained in the software industry and was now employed in the classroom as well.

That first semester was a crash course in teaching. Within seven weeks I had responded to two emergencies with no previous time for preparation. This taught me that it is possible to learn and teach at the same time and that everything is a grand experiment anyway. I have incorporated these key lessons into my life philosophy.

My career has been filled with intense challenges. I have learned that a tough challenge met can turn into the greatest fulfillment. Teaching was a huge challenge at the beginning. This was the most difficult professional task I ever faced, both intellectually and emotionally. But the reward in personal growth has been equally huge.

In my career of twenty-six years at Hewlett Packard, my most rewarding times were when I was teaching other engineers. As a software developer, I was the person that would evaluate new technologies and integrate them into our workflow. This requires teaching each person on the team how to use the technology appropriately. Now I am able to bring that to my students.

My time at UNC has shown me that I have always been a teacher. Years ago I adopted the personal mission statement "To Learn and Teach Best Practices" as my motto. This is in my bones and it is who I am. In a sense, this is a key part of my destiny.
