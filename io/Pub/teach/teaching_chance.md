## A Chance to Teach

It could not have come at a better time.  My career was in decline and I was feeling quite frustrated over the stagnation that was taking hold.  I had already had two full careers and I was only 57.  I was planning on retiring and spend my twilight years writing my memoirs.

My first career was in software engineering culminating in a decade of technical leadership of engineering teams.  This career was extremely successful and satisfying but also high stress.  The implosion of the tech industry after 9/11 and globalization made me want to launch out on my own and run my own engineering company.

I founded Shrinking World Solutions with the idea of building a medium-sized software engineering company.  I believed that brilliant engineers can easily become successful entrepreneurs.  How naive I was!

Running a business was nothing like engineering.  Over time I spent roughly 90% of my mental energy trying to do sales (getting new engineering business). While I have always found building software to be emotionally and intellectually rewarding, but sales is really soul-sucking for me.  After ten years I was ready to shut down the business and write full-time.

I remember sitting with my son at a park in London, where he was living while working on a PhD in Bio-informatics.  I was telling him about how discouraged I felt to have so much knowledge that I was unable to pass on. I had spent my life learning and now was ready to teach.

We discussed the dilemma of wanting to train others in software development without having to recruit students and manage the business details.  Josiah commented that universities solve that problem.  At the time I could not picture how to connect with opportunities to teach at a university.

About two months later I received an email from a business associate asking me if I would be interested in teaching at the University of Northern Colorado. Dave knew of my interest in training others and thought that it might extend to teaching college.  UNC had unexpectedly lost a professor and had a class in need of an instructor.
