## Early Computers

They say that 1968 was the key year for breakthroughs in computer engineering. The mouse, graphics terminals, integrated circuits, and AI all have their roots in that period. But from the first demonstrations of breakthroughs it was a long way to make them truly useful.

My first computer was a PDP 8/F, located in the Chemistry department of our local university. I was taking an Advanced Placement class in Organic Chemistry at high school. My Chemistry teacher arranged for me to go to the university once a week to work with a college professor, who showed me how to use the computer.

There were 16 binary switches that were used to set the initial address of boot-loader that would startup the system. This boot-loader would read the operating system from a magnetic tape drive. A teletype was used to enter programs written in BASIC. The program would be written from the memory to a paper-tape punch for permanent storage. I still have a few paper tapes of programs that I wrote in high school.

It was unthinkable at that time that average citizens would own computers. Large timeshare computers were equipped with: batch cards readers, teletypes, graphics terminals, tape drives, and line printers. They existed in data centers with high-powered air conditioning to draw off the heat. They were cared for by technicians in white lab coats.


## Hobbyists to Main Street

Programmers used teletype terminals or card punches to create programs. These were submitted to the timeshare computer by the technicians and a stack of fan-folder striped paper was returned the the results of the program output. During college I first started using video terminals (TV with a keyboard attached) to replace the teletypes.

The early 80s saw a large number of small computer introductions for hobbyists. The three main computers that were available when I was in college were the Commodore 64, Apple II, TRS-80. Each of these had a full address space of 64K bytes of RAM available. Byte Magazine published updated specs for all of the computers monthly to make us salivate and dream of what was coming out.

The IBM PC was introduced in 1981 and immediate set the standard by which all other computers were compared. There were several different operating systems that were run on the hardware. Anyone using a computer at this time was clearly a hobbyist who enjoyed computers for the novelty. They didn't actually do anything useful for real people but were an expensive toy.

I started my dream job in 1981, two weeks after I graduated from college. We moved from Arizona to Boise, Idaho where I began working with Hewlett-Packard. I was an Electrical Engineer but really had a passion for programming. I worked for Disc Memory Division of HP where we built a massive disk drive with 7 magnetic platters. I was now playing the big boys on the cutting edge of technology.
