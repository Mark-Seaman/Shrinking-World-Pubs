Social networking has become an essential part of our lives, but it can also be a double-edged sword. On one hand, technology has given us the power to connect with people and communities from around the world, but on the other hand, it has also raised concerns about privacy, security, and the impact of commercial interests. To navigate these challenges, it is essential to adopt healthy social networking practices.


One way to approach social networking is to use open-source social networking platforms such as Mastodon, Discord, Friendica, Pixelfeed, and Peertube. These platforms offer greater control over privacy and security, and they also promote collaboration and community-building.


Healthy social networking practices involve setting aspirations, practicing etiquette, building communities, and collaborating with others. Finding our people, following and unfollowing to tune our feed, using ad-blockers, performing regular audits, and managing our mindshare are some of the tips for using social networking tools effectively.


Finding our people means building connections with like-minded individuals, joining groups, and creating our own communities. We can also use follow and unfollow to tune our feeds, so that we only see content that is relevant to our interests. Ad-blockers can help us to limit unwanted and irrelevant content, while regular audits can help us to stay on track and achieve our goals. Finally, managing our mindshare is essential to maintain balance and perspective, so that we can make the most of our social networking experiences while maintaining our well-being.


By adopting healthy social networking practices, we can use technology to connect with others and build meaningful communities, while also protecting our privacy, managing our time and energy, and achieving our goals.
