# Communication Channels

Different people naturally respond on different communication channels. Being active on a channel means monitoring the traffic frequently enough to be able to respond quickly to incoming messages. Communicating with a person effectively means negotiating which channel to use and setting common expectations for how quickly to respond. When working with others, defining how we can communicate must be the first task that we work on.


## Primary Channels (daily)

My regular channels of communication include phone, email, text, social networking and messaging. Messages that come in here are seen within minutes.

* Email
* Phone
* Text
* Chat
* Mastodon


## Secondary Channels (once a month)

I also have the capability to use other methods of communication but these are not checked regularly. A message that comes in here may sit for a month before I see it. For a message to be seen people must contact contact me some other way to let me know that they left me a message.

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Instagram
* UNC Outlook
* Planning Center
* Greeley Vineyard App


## Non-channels (once a year)

Other communication channels are not active at all for me. On these messages may sit for a year or more before being discovered.

* FaceTime
* Linked-in
* Zoom
* You Tube
* WhatsApp
* SnapChat
* Discord
* Slack
* Tik Tok
* Github Chat
* Trello
* Microsoft Teams
