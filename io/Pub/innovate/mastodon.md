## Riding the Mastodon

Social Networking can be a great benefit to society, but its misuse can also pose a major threat. Ever since I watched the Social Dilemma on Netflix, I have been deeply concerned about the impact that social media has on our mental health and our society. Flaws are based on the business model that drives American companies. They are compelled to make decisions to increase profits despite any social implications.

Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are all driven by advertising and an algorithm is responsible for selecting content to show users that increases ad revenue. The selections are made by code that optimizes the probability that the user will follow the link. This favors the more sensational content, and minimizes the lesser.

This tends to push people toward more extreme content over time. People who spend significant time on Facebook and Twitter result in a measurable decrease in mental health and well-being. This is directly tied to how these services are constructed. We see the negative effects of this daily and yet most of us are powerless to do anything about it.

Open-source social media provides an alternative to this path of madness. There are alternative services to Twitter and Facebook that provide the same value to the users, but are not driven by commercial interests. In these services, the content is not selected for you by the software. Instead you choose who to follow and see all of the content that is posted.

These services are run for the public good and have no aspirations of making money. Because of that, they do not need to control the behavior of the users. This is the original aspiration of the internet, which has now been largely lost by the rise of advertising.

If social media is causing you stress, then leave that world before it causes permanent damage. Move to Mastodon from Twitter to lower stress due to doom scrolling and rage surfing. Twitter decides what you see and pushes you to the extreme. Mastodon lets you see all the messages from those you follow so you see what you want.

I have been astounded by the difference between the two services that provide such similar functionality. I never want to go back and regret waiting so long to make the jump. Elon Musk's meltdown of Twitter finally gave me the boost I needed to make this jump.
