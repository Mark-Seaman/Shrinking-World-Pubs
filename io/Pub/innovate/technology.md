# Key Role of Technology

Technology has shaped my entire adult life.  It is hard to contemplate what my
life would be like apart from it. My entire working career was spent in roles
related to computer engineering and most of my hobbies are hosted on computers
of one sort or another.

I love gadgets and appreciate superior design in any product, but especially in
computer hardware and software. For me, technology represents one of the highest
forms of creative problem-solving.

I love creating software because it is the one domain in which I can create a
world where I am in total control of every detail. If I don't like what is
happening I can change it to be exactly what I wish for.

Technology also represents my interface with the world. With a computer, I can
interact with people across the globe and have meaningful collaborations with
others I may seldom meet face-to-face.
