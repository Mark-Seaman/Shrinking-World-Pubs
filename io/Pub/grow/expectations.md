title: The Expectation Trap


Balancing Ideation and Execution has always been a struggle for me. As someone who loves generating new ideas and starting new projects, I have learned that every promising idea does not necessarily represent a commitment. It is important to carefully prioritize commitments and renegotiate past commitments when necessary.

One of the biggest challenges I face is the expectation trap - setting unrealistic expectations for myself and others, and then struggling to meet those expectations. As my own worst task master, I have to remind myself to avoid boiling the ocean and moving the goal post. In other words, I cannot commit to a plan that is so extensive or ambitious that it becomes unmanageable.

Preparation is often more valuable than planning. Instead of committing to a detailed plan that may be unachievable, it is better to focus on preparing for the next steps. This approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, which can be crucial in an unpredictable environment.

However, unmet expectations can still cause a crisis. It is important to communicate openly and honestly with stakeholders and team members to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Past commitments may need to be renegotiated, but this should be done as early as possible to minimize the impact on other people's plans and expectations.

In summary, ideation and execution are both important, but it is crucial to balance them carefully. The expectation trap can be avoided by prioritizing commitments, preparing rather than planning, and communicating openly and honestly with stakeholders. With these strategies in mind, we can generate new ideas and start new projects without sacrificing our ability to execute effectively.
