# Embrace Reality

io/grow/embrace-reality.md


I often wish my life was something other than what it actually is. But many circumstances in my life are already defined for me. My challenge is to understand reality as it is, not as I wish it to be. From this understanding, I can make plans to make the most out of my life.

Self-awareness lies at the heart of mental health and is required to manage life well. This means we must accept the truth and then work within the constraints of what we have been given to live life with meaning.

What does it mean to understand reality? I believe there are several dimensions to our psychology. Each of these gives a unique vantage point from which to assess life. Failure in any one of these dimensions will cause life to be less meaningful and joyful than it should be.

## Faces of Reality

These seven dimensions define my identity which affects everything else in my life.

* Control 
* Emotions
* Priorities
* Resources
* Awareness
* Needs
* Contribution


### Embracing the truth

We have looked briefly at seven different dimensions of the reality that we experience. Each of these represents a perspective or lens through which we see the world around us. Each face of reality has its own failure and success path. Becoming aware of each dimension lets us manage it more effectively.

Overcoming the common pitfalls is required if we intend to live the best possible life. Each of these key perspectives is worth pondering. There will be little growth without self-reflection. I have found some of these truths to be hard to swallow and neglecting them has brought me much regret.

I hope that where ever you find yourself today that you will pause and reflect, learn, and grow. There is always more. The road of personal transformation is the road the health and the best possible life.
