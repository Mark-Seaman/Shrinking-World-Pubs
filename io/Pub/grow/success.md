# Defining Success

io/grow/success.md


The concept of success is highly personal and subjective, and can vary greatly from person to person. For some individuals, success may be defined as achieving a certain level of financial or career success, while for others it may be about personal growth, fulfilling relationships, or making a positive impact in the world.

However, one thing that is true for everyone is that our values play a significant role in shaping our feelings of success. When we define success in a way that is aligned with our values, we are more likely to feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction when we achieve our goals.

So, what are values, exactly? In simplest terms, values are the things that we believe are important in life. They can be abstract concepts like honesty, compassion, or freedom, or more concrete things like family, career, or health.

Our values are deeply ingrained within us and often develop over the course of our lives through our experiences, relationships, and cultural influences. They are what guide our decisions, shape our attitudes, and influence our behaviors.

When it comes to defining success, our values are a crucial factor to consider. If we define success solely based on external factors such as money, power, or status, we may find that achieving these goals doesn't bring us the fulfillment or satisfaction we expected. On the other hand, if we measure success by personal growth, meaningful relationships, and pursuing our passions, we may find that we experience more lasting happiness.

To understand this more fully, let's take a look at some common values and how they might shape our definition of success.
