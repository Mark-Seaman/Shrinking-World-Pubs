# Building Trust

io/grow/building-trust.md

Relationships require trust to be healthy.
My main objective then is to have meaningful conversations that build trust. Many of my interactions
erode the trust and eliminate my desire to keep the interaction going.  
I want to replace the
relationships lacking trust with ones that bring joy.

Relationships without trust are painful to me and I have little desire to relate to those out of a
sense of duty or obligation. Polite formality is how I handle these interactions and I admit that
there is no hope for anything better.

True trust requires that I am confident in the other person's

- **Competence** - ability to do the thing they say they will do
- **Character** - the virtues that define their maturity
- **Caring** - how they care about my needs compared to their own
