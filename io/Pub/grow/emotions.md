# The Power of Emotions

io/grow/emotions.md


I believe that emotional maturity is measured by our ability to manage pleasure and pain in our lives.  In fact, the definition of maturity for me is the ability to have a appropriate response of pleasure and pain to match the current circumstances.

Note that this is different that optimize pleasure while minimizing pain.  Both of these are necessary responses depending on the situation.  It is unhealthy to have an inappropriate response to the world that we live in.

Our brains are wired physiologically to produce [neurochemicals](https://www.dana.org/article/neurotransmitters/) for both pleasure and pain.  This is a fully automatic response that we cannot prevent. Different chemicals signal different emotional responses: anger, fear, shame, sadness, joy, love.  Both the positive and negative emotions release a chemical response within our bodies.

One difficulty we face is that the system is tuned toward the negative emotions. The pleasure response is about 1/4 of the total impact of the negative response.  Our brains want us to be angry, fearful, sad and ashamed, while allowing us to be joyful on occasion.
