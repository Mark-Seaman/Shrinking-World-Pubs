# Finding Meaningful Work

io/grow/meaningful-work.md


At the very heart of meaningful work is the urge to create. This can take on many forms. Creativity may be expressed in writing, software design, teaching techniques or just plain old problem solving. A day without creativity is like a day without sunshine.

There are several core attributes of meaning in work life. If any of these is missing it will be impossible to have a sense of fulfillment related to work. It is worth spending time regularly thinking about the factors which provide the motivation that you need.

Aspects of motivation

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose
* Connection

## Autonomy

Each of us have a need to be free to choose what we work on as well as how and where we work. That is what makes micromanagement so devastating to motivation. As control over our decisions tightens our autonomy disappears. We must regain autonomy over our work in order to have productive interaction with others.

Each person is accountable for results. Constraints on how the work is done should be expressed as objectives, rather than directives. This amplifies the personal accountability that each person feels for the goals of each project.

Every project has a boss of some kind (client, customer, manager). The primary role of the boss is to define what success looks like. They set the constraints for a good outcome. The worker on the other hand must be responsible for the planning and execution that works within those constraints.

This involves a lot of problem solving that should be done by the worker, not the boss. If the boss is trying to solve the interesting problems then the workers will quickly lose motivation because it is clear that they are not being trusted to make any important decisions.

Another important aspect of autonomy for me is the ability to choose the projects that I work on and who I work with. This allows me to pursue my interests while meeting the goals of the project and the organization. It encourages me to develop creative ideas and solve problems


## Mastery

Everyone has a deep desire to be an expert at something. This is an innate need for every human. That is what explains why people would devote their free time to learning to play a musical instrument or learning to speak a foreign language.

I desire to build my expertise and develop best practices that go far beyond the minimum requirements for the task at hand. Pride in accomplishments is developed along with skill and knowledge. Refinement and optimization come as new skills are practiced.

Skills take a great deal of practice to reach higher levels of proficiency. Developing skills is not a linear progression but more like a series of plateaus that are reached. Each level requires a fundamental change in behavior and understanding. I've developed the following scale to quantify the practice time required for different levels of skill.

Quantified Skill

    Beginner - 10 hours
    Competent - 100 hours
    Proficient - 1000 hours
    Expert - 10,000 hours

Creativity is another important aspect of mastery. All people are creative but some have an insatiable desire to express their creativity. If this desire cannot be expressed as part of the work role then the work will lose the potential benefit.

The creative process has a rhythm to it. There is a workflow and a lifecycle that affects how ideas are captured, nurtured, and developed. If the work environment does not respect that natural rhythm then the creativity of the workers will be completely lost.

Few creative people will tolerate being treated like a cog in a machine, doing menial task that do not require much creativity. If you want people that are masters then the environment must encourage it. Certain work environments have a culture of creativity where creatives can thrive.


## Purpose

Purpose is an essential part of happiness. Without knowing that you are fulfilling the purpose of your life you will be faced with a constant gnawing sense of discouragement, disillusion, and anger.

Abraham Maslow, in 1943 highlighted five levels of essential human needs. These must be addressed in order of priority, from the basic physical needs to the thing that he identified as "Self-actualization".

In my thinking this highest level is about understanding your life purpose. What is the thing that you are ideally suited to do that few others can even come close to? What uniqueness must you express to be all that you can be?

When you can answer this question you are on track for describing your life purpose. If you cannot succinctly describe your purpose then you are very unlikely to live it out.

I recommend that you attempt to write your purpose using no more than seven words. This forces you to truly capture the essence and let go of the supporting clarifications.

Once you get to your seven-word motto, you can write a one page description that explains how this works out in practice. This is your filter. Everything that exists in your life should be there to help you fulfill your purpose. If not then prune it.

Your purpose becomes your destiny as you move toward it. I believe that destiny is not about the actions that we take but the person that we become. Over time, we become a certain kind of person, by growing our capabilities and character to fulfill our life purpose.

The actions that we take are merely a bi-product of who we are becoming. Living out our destiny is realizing the full potential of all the resources we have been given and living with a true purpose.

Your purpose must involve helping others and not just stroking your own ego. You need a larger vision that lets you see how the world around you can be improved. Creating value for others and influencing them to live a better life are both key ingredients that will lead you toward fulfillment.


## Connection

Marcus Buckingham is one of the world leaders in the area of what makes humans perform at exceptional levels. In his research for the Gallup organization he discovered that the most important question that signified happiness at work was, "Do you have a best friend at work?"

People that have meaningful connections at work are smarter, more content, and work more productively than others. A sense of teamwork and interdependence is indispensable to high performance.

Mutual respect, trust, and appreciation must be present to create a sense of mutual commitment that is required to accomplish the work. A team must be able to learn and teach and work through conflict. Without great teamwork a group will produce a small fraction of its true potential.

As teams jell a sense of community develops. This is fertile ground for collaboration and interdependence. This creates a positive environment where everyone can flourish.
