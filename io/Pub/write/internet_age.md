# The Internet age

The way that people consume information requires a new type of writing. The internet has changed how we think, and this is clear in how we now consume information. People no longer are likely to sit through a 1000-page book on a subject of casual interest, unless they are required to.

The way that most people consume information is limited to very short articles that can be digested quickly. Current trends favor shorter articles of a single paragraph with 100-300 words.Longer articles run around 1000 words (or four pages of typeset text).

For the last few years, I have tailored my writing to this new short attention span. I now write for readers who are accustomed to the internet, which trends to a short attention span (like that of a squirrel). Large articles tend to be saved for later and often never read.

Readers also expect to be drawn into reading. Having a great headline with 10 words creates curiosity that entices the reader to read the next paragraph with 100 words. This may ultimately result in the reader consuming a long article consisting of 1000 words. I write in this style(headline, paragraph, article) to earn the reader's trust gradually.
