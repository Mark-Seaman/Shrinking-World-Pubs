# Writing My Story

I first became interested in writing my life story when my dad published his
memoir seventeen years ago.  In reading through his book, I realized what an
extraordinary life he had lived.

From abject poverty and abuse, he went on to accomplish things that few others
have ever done.  What struck me was, not just the depth of progress that he made in his
career field, but also the breadth of activity that he sustained throughout 
his lifetime.

This got me thinking about my own life.  I began to see that I have had some
amazing experiences over the years.  It has always been my intent to live life 
with a passion.  I have been deeply committed to lifelong learning and desire
to understand things at a deep level.

As I rolled north of sixty, telling my story became my primary focus.  I realized
that the clock was ticking and that I had insights that I needed to pass on 
to others.  I've been working steadily on the project for the last couple of years.
