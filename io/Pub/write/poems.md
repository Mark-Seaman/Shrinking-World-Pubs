Over the last few years I have been writing poetry.  I'm getting ready to publish my first book 
of poems.

Recently my entire professional life has been heavily impacted by the recent development in Open.AI.
I have started using ChatGPT to create a starting point for poems.  It is extremely clever and I
am thrilled with the experience.

Here I will present some poems along the ChatGPT prompt that was used to create it.
