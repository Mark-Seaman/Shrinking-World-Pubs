## Deep Dive in Doodly

I've recently decided to dive into the deep end of Doodly.
This is a tool that allows the creation of aminated drawing videos with a
voice over.   

For years I have been drawn to this style of edutainment.  In my web development
class at UNC I have a project that involves the 
[RSA Animations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39BF9545D740ECFF) 
produced by the
Royal Society for the Arts in UK.

I've recently purchased a copy of Doodly  and spent some time just learning 
about it.  With a day's effort I produced my first video.   There are a lot
of moving parts but they have some great training vids to help you get started.

This has opened up a whole new realm for me to explore.  I'm imagining how I
might incorporate this into my class room experience in the Fall.

When learning new areas I can only learn so much before I feel compelled to 
produce something.  I am very inpatient when it comes to creative projects.
I want them to be complete as quickly as I can imagine them.

Doodly gives me tool that allows me to express ideas in a fresh way.  
I am extremely excited to see where this will take me.

projects.  The video is 6 minutes long. It explains the similarity of differing
types of creative projects.
