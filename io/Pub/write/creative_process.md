Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist and bestselling author, has written extensively about his writing process. In his book "Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World," he shares his method for generating and refining ideas, as well as his strategies for overcoming writer's block.

- **Idea generation**: Grant starts by generating as many ideas as possible, without censoring or judging them. He calls this "brainstorming without borders," and he uses various techniques to stimulate his creativity, such as mind-mapping, free-writing, and asking provocative questions.

- **Incubation**: After generating ideas, Grant steps away from them and allows them to incubate. This can involve taking a break, engaging in a different activity, or simply letting the ideas simmer in the back of his mind. He believes that this step is crucial for allowing the ideas to mature and develop.

- **Feedback**: Once the ideas have had time to incubate, Grant seeks feedback from others. He shares his ideas with trusted friends, colleagues, and mentors, and he listens carefully to their feedback, incorporating it into his work as necessary.

- **Iteration**: Based on the feedback he receives, Grant iterates and refines his ideas, making multiple passes over his work until he is satisfied with the final product. He emphasizes that this is an ongoing process, and that even after he has finished a piece of writing, he is always looking for ways to improve it.

- **Persistence**: Finally, Grant emphasizes the importance of persistence in the writing process. He acknowledges that writing can be difficult and frustrating, but he believes that the most successful writers are those who are able to push through these challenges and stay committed to their work over the long term.

Overall, Grant's process emphasizes the importance of generating a large quantity of ideas, seeking feedback from others, and iterating and refining one's work over time. He also emphasizes the importance of persistence and resilience in the face of the challenges that inevitably arise during the writing process.
