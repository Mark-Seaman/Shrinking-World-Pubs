We all experience a great deal of pressure to be productive, especially if you are a driven personality. We believe that producing published material is the most important goal in writing. I believe that this attitude is counterproductive.

If you are forced to write on demand then you may need to be produce results on demand. But this drive will significantly reduce the quality of the work. If great writing comes from gathering and expressing insights, then it cannot be scheduled.

Words on a page mean nothing if they have no heart. Fully engaging the Mind and Heart takes time. It is hard to do this on a schedule. Consider developing a stockpile of articles and then publishing them on a schedule. Don't allow the publishing deadline to force a writing deadline.

Understanding is a natural process that comes from living life and reflecting deeply. So ... live life and reflect deeply. Ponder the meaning of everything, especially the painful experiences. Great writing comes from pain, so go get you some pain.

Go out and take some foolish chances and then learn from them. If you do, other people will be able to learn from you or at least be amused by your foolishness.

When confronted with a choice in writing, choose quality over quantity.
