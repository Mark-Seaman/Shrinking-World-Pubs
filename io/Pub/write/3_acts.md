Story in Three Acts

by Mark Seaman

The typical life journey can be told in three acts.


## Act 1 - setup

Normal life is interrupted by an unexpected journey. You wrestle with whether to pursue the journey
or take the safe path of comfort. Ultimately you choose to do the hard thing and the adventure
truly begins.

* the ordinary world 
* the call to adventure 
* reluctance to answer the call 
* role of mentors


## Act 2 - engagement

There is a point of no return where a whole new reality is revealed. This reality is filled with
unforeseen dangers and fears. Eventually, there is a showdown where a breakthrough occurs.

* crossing the threshold 
* discovery of a new world 
* difficult challenges 
* camaraderie of companions 
* overcoming for the reward (central crisis) 
* transformation


## Act 3 - resolution

After the climax, there is still plenty left in the story. There may be ongoing conflict that is
required to fully gain the wisdom that is needed for the future. It is also crucial to pass
everything that was gained onto others for their benefit.

* continuing conflict and setbacks 
* reluctance to return 
* crossing the threshold with the treasure 
* passing the benefit 
* wisdom & power in both worlds
