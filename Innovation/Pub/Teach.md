# Teach the approach to others

If you know something special then you must be willing to teach it. Teach what you know to
others. Effective innovation doesn't
happen in a vacuum. It requires collaboration, knowledge sharing, and training. That's why it's
important to teach the approach to others. Here are some ways you can do that:

## Create a Training Program

Identify the training needs of your team and develop the best path for training to address those needs.
Identify those who can act as both trainers and mentors and devote time to the learning activities
required.

I taught software skills to a team of developers by taking a hands-on
approach. Pairing with experienced developers is an excellent way to improve everyone's skill.
Doing small projects together provided regular opportunity for feedback and coaching. As
a result, the new developers' skills improved significantly, and they became an truly effective team.

## Hold Workshops and Seminars

Identify the topics and objectives that you want to cover in your workshops and seminars. Develop
materials and activities that engage your team members and promote learning. Identify facilitators
who are experts in the topics you're covering and schedule and deliver your workshops and
seminars.

Use the internet to provide free materials to learn and grow.  It may also be worthwhile to buy 
educational materials or attend more formal workshops to guide the required learning.

## Provide Coaching and Mentoring

Identify areas for improvement in your team members and pair them with mentors who can help them
grow. Develop a coaching plan that outlines the steps your team members will take to improve and
monitor their progress. Provide feedback to your team members on their progress and encourage them
to continue to grow and develop.

## Encourage Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration

Create a culture of knowledge sharing and provide platforms for collaboration. Encourage team
members to share their expertise and recognize and reward collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Teaching what you know to others is an important part of effective innovation. By creating a training
program, holding workshops and seminars, providing coaching and mentoring, and encouraging
knowledge sharing and collaboration, you can help your team members grow and develop, and build a
culture of innovation within your entire organization.
