# Plan an approach to the solution

When faced with a problem, it is important to have a structured approach to finding a solution. Here
are some steps you can take to plan an approach to the solution.

The first step in solving any problem is to clearly define the problem statement. This involves
gathering information about the problem, identifying the root cause of the problem, and defining
the scope of the problem. The problem statement should be clear and concise.

Once you have defined the problem statement, you need to set goals and objectives. These should be
specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). You should also identify any
constraints and limitations and define the success criteria.

With the problem statement and goals and objectives defined, you can begin to brainstorm possible
solutions. Conduct research to gather information, encourage creativity and open-mindedness, and
use ideation techniques like mind mapping, brainwriting, or SCAMPER. It is important to generate a
large quantity of ideas before evaluating them.

After generating a list of possible solutions, you need to evaluate and select the best solution.
Create a decision matrix or other evaluation tool, define the evaluation criteria, evaluate the
solutions against the criteria, and select the best solution based on the evaluation results.

By following these steps, you can plan an approach to the solution that is structured and effective.
Remember to keep an open mind and be creative when brainstorming possible solutions, and use a
structured approach when evaluating and selecting the best solution.
