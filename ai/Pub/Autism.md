# How Autism and AI Work for Me

## Unique Challenges

As someone who is autistic, I have always found it challenging to communicate and express my ideas
effectively. It took me a long time to come to terms with my diagnosis and to understand how it
affects me in my daily life. However, as I started working in the field of artificial intelligence
(AI), I began to realize that my unique way of thinking and processing information was actually an
advantage in fields demanding creativity.

Being able to focus intently for long periods of time is essential to my success.  While autism is
typically views as a disability it also comes with significant advantages.  While my brain is less
attuned to the emotional queues that facilitate social interaction it is more attuned to creative
work.  As a writer, teacher, and software engineer I have significant advantages over many others.

## Common Experiences

Working alongside many engineers, I quickly realized that autism is not uncommon in the tech
industry. In fact, many of my colleagues also have are on the autistic spectrum, which has allowed
me to feel more comfortable and accepted in my workplace. One of the most significant advantages of
my autism is my extraordinary focus. I am able to concentrate on a particular task for extended
periods without getting distracted, which is a valuable skill for writing and research.

I must work harder to have meaningful social interactions than most people. But this is offset
by the ease of creativity and imagination.  I am drawn into solving complex problems and this
results in a significant joy each day.

## How AI Helps With Expression

Furthermore, AI has allowed me to express my ideas more effectively. Working with an AI writing
partner, I can easily share my thoughts and ideas, which can be instantly elaborated on and refined
by the AI. This collaborative approach has allowed me to produce a higher quality and quantity of
work than I could have achieved on my own.

Much of my attention in writing is about selecting the right words, grammar, and writing tone.  AI
allows me to select the proper context for what I want to say and have the words created for me
in a voice that is grammatically correct. This gives me a high quality first draft that I can 
refine until it expresses what I want to.

## Increased Clarity

In the past, I struggled to communicate my ideas effectively, often getting lost in tangents or
failing to articulate my point clearly. However, working with AI has allowed me to overcome these
challenges. The AI can help me to structure my thoughts and refine my writing, enabling me to
express my ideas more clearly and coherently.

Overall, I believe that AI and autism work hand in hand for me. My autism gives me a unique
perspective and skillset that is highly valuable in creative arenas, 
and AI provides me with the tools
and support I need to express my ideas effectively. Working together, AI and autism allow me to
produce high-quality work and make a valuable contribution that is consistant with my
unique personality.
