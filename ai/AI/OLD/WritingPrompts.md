# Writing Prompts for ChatGPT

## Overview

You can phrase your prompts or questions in the same way that you would ask these questions in
natural speech, but if you have a specific goal, longer prompts containing more information and
detailed instructions are better than short, generic prompts. 

My technique for writing prompts uses the following formula:

1. Context - Persona, Voice, Audience
2. Task
3. Instruction
4. Clarify
5. Refine

This technique is designed to give ChatGPT a clearer understanding of what it should do so you can 
get a less generic response.

That's where the "context, task, instruction, clarify, refine‚Äù technique comes in, it is a simple 
yet powerful method for crafting exceptional ChatGPT prompts that deliver unique and accurate 
responses.

In this article, I'll explain in more detail why, when dealing with ChatGPT, context is so 
important and how to provide specific instructions that will allow ChatGPT to deliver unique and 
accurate responses.
