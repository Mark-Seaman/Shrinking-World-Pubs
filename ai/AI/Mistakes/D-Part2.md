## Ways to Avoid Unclear Project Goals

As a software developer, it's not easy to deal with project goals that are vague or poorly defined. You may end up producing subpar work, or even worse, complete waste. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent this from happening. 

Firstly, you should avoid leaving everything to the AI. While automatic tools can be a valuable asset in generating ideas and suggestions, relying on them exclusively can lead to incoherent messes. You should also leave room for human intervention, as it is essential to evaluate the goals and make sure they are valid and achievable. 

Secondly, brainstorming with an AI is a viable strategy, but you must have a top-level outline constructed manually. A top-level outline will give the AI a sense of direction, which it can then analyze and refine. 

Lastly, the AI can be used to hydrate the outline. Once you have the top-level outline, you may now use the AI to enhance it by providing detailed information to it. Once you have detailed information, and a clear outline, you are ready to start your project.

In summary, it is essential to establish clear and defined goals for your project to avoid confusion. In conclusion, you can achieve this by utilizing automatic tools like AI to help you with the brainstorming stage, always building a top-level outline manually and then allowing the AI to improve it.
