# Database & ORM

## Database
A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, modification, and management of the data. It is like a digital filing cabinet that stores information. Databases are widely used in various applications to store and manage large amounts of data, such as user profiles, product information, and financial transactions.

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
ORM, which stands for Object-Relational Mapping, is a technique or a software tool that allows you to interact with a database using object-oriented programming concepts. It provides a way to map the objects in your application code to the tables and records in the database.

With an ORM, you can perform database operations, such as inserting data, retrieving data, updating data, and deleting data, using familiar object-oriented methods and syntax. This means that you don't have to write complex SQL queries or deal with low-level database operations directly. The ORM handles all the underlying database operations for you, making it easier and more efficient to work with databases.

## How does ORM work?
Under the hood, an ORM library translates your high-level object-oriented operations into the corresponding SQL queries that the database understands. It handles all the necessary database connections, query generation, and result processing, so you can focus on writing clean and readable code.

By using an ORM, you can define database tables as classes (models) in your application code. Each instance of a class represents a row in the corresponding database table, and each attribute or property of the class represents a column in the table. You can then use the ORM's methods and attributes to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these objects, which automatically translates to SQL queries executed on the database.

## Advantages of using ORM
- **Simplifies database operations:** ORM abstracts away the complexities of writing raw SQL queries and managing database connections. This simplifies the development process and allows you to focus on your application logic.
- **Language independence:** With ORM, you can write database operations using the programming language you are already familiar with, rather than having to learn and write SQL queries.
- **Improved code reusability:** ORM allows you to define reusable models (classes) that can be used across different parts of your application. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.
- **Database portability:** Since ORM libraries can work with different database systems, you can switch between databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) without changing your application code significantly.
- **Advanced querying capabilities:** ORM libraries provide high-level query APIs that allow you to perform complex database queries using simple method calls. This makes it easier to fetch specific data from the database based on various conditions.

Overall, using an ORM can enhance your productivity as a developer by simplifying database operations and providing a more intuitive and efficient way to interact with databases using object-oriented programming concepts.
