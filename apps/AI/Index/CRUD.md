# CRUD Operations

**CRUD** stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**. These operations are the most common and fundamental operations used in software development to manipulate data in databases.

1. **Create**: The `Create` operation is used to add new records or objects to a database. It involves inserting new data into a database table or creating new objects based on a predefined data model.

2. **Read**: The `Read` operation is used to retrieve or fetch data from a database or data source. It involves querying the database to retrieve specific records or objects based on selected criteria.

3. **Update**: The `Update` operation is used to modify or update existing records or objects in a database. It involves making changes to the existing data by updating the values and fields of the selected records.

4. **Delete**: The `Delete` operation is used to remove or delete existing records or objects from a database. It involves permanently removing the selected records or objects from the database, making them no longer accessible.

These operations are the basic building blocks for managing data in a database or any data storage system. They are essential for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in a structured and controlled manner, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data.
