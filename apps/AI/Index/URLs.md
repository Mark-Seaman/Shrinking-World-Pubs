# URLs

URLs, which stands for Uniform Resource Locators, are a way to specify the address of a specific resource on the internet. In the context of web development with Django, URLs are used to map incoming requests to specific views in your application.

URLs in Django are defined in the `urls.py` file of your project. Each URL pattern consists of a regular expression pattern and the corresponding view function that should be executed when a request matches that pattern.

When a request is made to your Django application, Django compares the requested URL against the patterns defined in your `urls.py` file. If a match is found, Django calls the corresponding view function, which can then process the request and generate a response.

URLs can also include placeholders or parameters, allowing you to capture specific values from the URL and pass them as arguments to your view function. This is useful for creating dynamic URL patterns, such as when you want to display specific information based on a unique identifier in the URL.

Overall, URLs are a crucial component of a Django application as they define the structure and flow of your web pages. Understanding how to define and map URLs to views is essential for building effective web applications.
