# Using Evernote Tags

Articles will go through four distinct stages of development: Capture, Organize,
Develop, Share.  This lifecycle of writing defines a standard workflow.  The
Evernote system is used to organize content as it evolves. Tags provide the
access to the articles in each of these stages.

To get a list of all of the articles at a specific development phase for a given
topic I search for the topic tag and the workflow tag. The following tags are
used for the basic workflow.

- idea - Capture stage
- draft - Organize phase
- refine - Develop phase
- publish - Share phase

This creates four queues for essential workflow management.  Notes are marked
with the 'idea' tag when they represent a headline or outline of some concept
that will eventually turn into a published article.  The exact shape of the
publication is completely undefined at this point, but the desire is to avoid
losing the insight altogether.

A topic tagged with 'draft' means that there is a first cut at the actual
discussion but it still needs a lot of work.  This initial draft will be
rewritten a couple of times before being published. This creates a queue of
topics that are at the early stages of development. When I'm in a proper state
of mind to rewrite a draft there is a ready list of candidates available to work
on.

The 'refine' tag is used to queue up articles that need one final edit before
releasing them to the public.  An Evernote search will yield a list of topics
that are almost ready for publication.  Each article needs to be edited for
grammar, spelling, voice, and word selection.  

The articles that are ready to publish are marked with a 'publish' tag.  This
selects those topics that need to be moved from the Evernote device where all of
the development is done to some appropriate writing venue.  Articles are removed
from Evernote to eliminate any possible confusion about where the master copy of
the topic is located.
