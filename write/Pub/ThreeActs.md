# Story in Three Acts

by Mark Seaman

---

The typical life journey can be told in three acts.  



## Act 1 - setup

Normal life is interrupted by an unexpected journey.  You wrestle with whether
to pursue the journey or take the safe path of comfort.  Ultimately you choose
to do the hard thing and the adventure truly begins.

- the ordinary world
- the call to adventure
- reluctance to answer the call
- role of mentors


## Act 2 - engagement

There is a point of no return where a whole new reality is revealed.  This 
reality is filled with unforeseen dangers and fears.  Eventually there is a
showdown where a breakthrough occurs.

- crossing the threshold
- discovery of a new world
- difficult challenges
- camaraderie of companions
- overcoming for the reward (central crisis)
- transformation


## Act 3 - resolution

After the climax there is still plenty left in the story.  There may be ongoing 
conflict that is required to fully gain the wisdom that is needed for the 
future. It is also crucial to pass everything that was gained onto others for
their benefit.

- continuing conflict and set backs
- reluctance to return
- crossing the threshold with the treasure
- passing the benefit
- wisdom & power in both worlds
