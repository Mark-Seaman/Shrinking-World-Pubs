# Upcoming Book

I've been working diligently on writing my next book. The book will contain stories from my life about events that shaped my thinking. 

I've been thinking about this project for several years now and have begun to write specific stories about places visited and people that I've met along the way. Throughout the project I've grown to appreciate how many extraordinary adventures that I've had.

I've written and published about 50,000 words (200 pages) so far and I expect to publish the book at about 300 pages. Many of the stories deal with travel throughout the world (North, Central, and South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East). Each of these travels connected me to an area of the world where often wild changes were taking place.

These events profoundly shaped my thoughts about what it means to live in this world. As a contrarian by nature, I want to give people another perspective on life. This book is intended to make people think about their lives from a new viewpoint. I use the true stories to illustrate many gaps that I see in American culture today.

While growing up in middle-class white suburbia, my life has not been typical. I've gotten to see the ragged fringes of our society and in other parts of the world. Travel , more than any other factor, has had a dramatic impact on my life. I want to share those insights with you.

You can enjoy the work in progress by visiting the website . As the book becomes ready this website will be converted into Amazon Kindle eBook and later a paperback version will be published.

I recommend starting with these three stories
- Under the Mushroom Cloud
- Nightmare at Red Rocks
- My Grandfather
