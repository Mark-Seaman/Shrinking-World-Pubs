# Interview for the Story

by Mark Seaman

---

A life story is about a journey. There is an arc to the plot. These questions
are designed to help someone think through the arc of their own story.


## Part 1 - setup

What was life like growing up and how did that set you up for what happened
later?

What was the moment that altered your life path and set you on your course of 
action?

Did you struggle with the decision to pursue the new path?

What people supported you during this time?


## Part 2 - engagement

When did you know that you could no longer go back?

What did the new world look like to you then; what major challenges did you
have to face?

What companions joined you on your journey?

What was the core battle and how did that experience transform you?


## Part 3 - resolution

What took place after the turning point?  Did things settle down immediately
or was there an extended struggle?

Did you have difficulty reconnecting with your old life?

How did you pass on the wisdom and benefits that you gained to others?

What is the next challenge that you are embarking on?
