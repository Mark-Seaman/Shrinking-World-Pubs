# Humans Tell Stories

Telling stories is fundamental to the human experience.  Stories are intended to
impact both the intellect and the emotions. Stories call people to take action
because behavior is controlled by our emotions. 

We can all relate to the feeling of knowing what we must do but feeling
powerless to do it for lack of motivation.  Once the emotions are stirred then
we find the will to do what is needed.  Feelings are the fire that drives the
engine.

We like to believe that humans are rational beings that emote, but in reality, we
are emotional beings that rationalize.  Emotions always drive behavior, and the
intellect attempts to come up with a decent rationalization.

A great story motivates and guides by engaging both the heart and the head.
While the intellect may guide us in the right direction it is necessary to touch
the emotions to get us to move.

Stories provide us with a guiding narrative that allows us to make sense of our
lives.  Our story both reveals and shapes the beliefs and values that we have. 
By changing the guiding story of your life you will change what you value most
and what you believe to be true.

Your story is a narrative that reveals what you believe.  This is far more
accurate than what people say that they believe.  For example, I may claim to be
humble and generous, but if my life story is about winning at the expense of
others then which one is true?
