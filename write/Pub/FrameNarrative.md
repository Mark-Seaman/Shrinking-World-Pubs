# Story within a Story

A frame narrative can be used to provide a large story line for other
self-contained stories.  Often one of the characters in one of the embedded
stories in used to narrate the frame story and act as the omniscient guide.

This story structure has a long history and dates back to the Odyssey and 1001
Arabian Nights.  This is an effective tool to use when the embedded stories
share a context but you don't want the nested stories to be overly constrained
by each other.

The frame story may provide the overall rules that constrain the storytelling
context while the inner stories are episodic.  The outer and inner stories but
rely on each other to build a complete and satisfying story arc.
