# Defining Moments


Each of our lives turns on a series of experiences that bring us clarity. It is
usually a time of great upheaval with everything at stake. These events become
defining moments in our lives. And we attribute great importance to them. 

At each life stage our experiences and reactions are radically different. For
most of us these defining experiences explain some fundamental part of our life
journey. These are often the moments when we make vows.

It is likely that you can think of specific events from your youth and your
young adult life and mid-life that set the tone for the rest of that life stage.
 Certain events can take on a far greater importance to us when we feel that
they reveal some deep truth. Experiences like a job failure, accident,
betrayal, wedding, or childbirth may take on deep meaning to us. These events
change who we are and how we think.

What are those defining moments for you? Think about each life stage you have
experienced so far: Youth, Young Adult, Mid-life, Old age. What one or two
experiences defined how you see the world and what you believe to be true? Why
did that event have such significance in your life? What vow did you make as a
result?

Now pick one defining moment from you entire life. Describe what happened and
what you felt. Dig deep in the emotional landscape that you are standing on.
Mine what lies beneath. Feel the weight of this moment, for it has truly changed
your life. Put this story into words so that others can relive your experience
and see through your eyes.
