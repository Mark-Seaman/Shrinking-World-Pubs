# Your Story Tells Who You Are

A couple of years ago I caught myself telling others my life story and was
shocked to hear how negative it sounded.  From the outside I have led a pretty
amazing life.

I have traveled the world, met a large number of famous people, worked on
cutting edge of technology, and been involved in ministry my whole adult life.
But the reality on the inside looks very different.

I struggle with fear of failure, self-doubt, pride, anger, self-pity, and have
difficulty connecting with others.  When I told my closest friends my story it
sounded less like a victory march and more like a dirge.

When you tell a story you are putting forth a view of reality, which includes
not only the facts but the feelings that accompany them.   I found that telling
my story revealed that my beliefs about my life were deeply (and
inappropriately) skewed toward the negative.

I began to retell my story and to learn from the process.  I listened to the
story and asked probing questions.  I found that, indeed, my life was far better
and more meaningful than I was giving myself credit for.  This marked a turning
point for me on the journey toward self-awareness.

How you tell your story reveals your innermost thoughts about yourself and the
world around you.  Do you recite the hurts that others have caused or do you
celebrate the kindness of strangers?  Practice telling your story and see what
it reveals.
