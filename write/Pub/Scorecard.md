# Writer's Scorecard

Success as a writer depends on producing both quality and quantity.  Quality is
a direct result of experience, which involves producing lots of low-quality
work.  Over time skill will rise resulting in an overall increase in total
quality produced. This is true even if the success rate is unchanged.

As a writer with autistic leaning I am constantly crafting stories and ideas for
stories and worlds from scratch.  But these don't become writing until they are
expressed in words.  Expression of ideas makes them concrete and tangible. Until
that happens they are ephemeral and temporal.

Writing is measurable.  It is an act of creation that gives life to ideas.  The
words written can be measured to see how often this act has taken place.  
Writing has both breadth and depth. I organize my writing into articles that
consist of 200 to 1000 words each.  These articles are combined  into venues for
publishing.

I have developed a scorecard to track the quantity of writing that I have done. 
For each venue I count the articles and words that have been written.  To pay
homage to my personality quirks these are compared to the numbers from one month
ago so that I feel good about myself.
