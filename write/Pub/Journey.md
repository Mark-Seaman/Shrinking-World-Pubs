# Writing is a Journey


Writing is a Journey, not a destination. I get to the destination by taking the
journey. 

Developing a regular practice of writing will naturally produce output in the
form of Books, Blog articles, Poems, Podcasts, and Videos.   But the output is
too far away to provide motivation.  The reward is too meager to justify the
investment of time and energy.

Writing should never be a discipline; it should be a liberation.  Expressing my
ideas is a privilege that releases great joy.  Being able to write is a freedom
not a responsibility based in some kind of duty.  Ultimately, writing is me
fulfilling my life purpose to share my ideas with others.

When the joy is gone, I will retire my pen.
