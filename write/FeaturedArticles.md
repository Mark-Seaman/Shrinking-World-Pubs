I am working on a new book.

A Seaman's Journey - Events that shaped my world

by Mark Seaman

---

This book explores what it means to be alive right now in America.
Stories from the life of Mark Seaman and his friends are used to examine
what is working well and also the challenges that we face as a society.

America in today stands at the threshold of history.  There has never been
a time and place like now and here.  There are some amazing opportunities
and some rather frightening scenarios in our future.

Join me in looking back to look forward.
