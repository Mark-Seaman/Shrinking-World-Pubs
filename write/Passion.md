# Your Passion Is Your Purpose

When it comes to writing let your passions guide you. Writing is about
expressing ideas. Great writing requires passion, while adequate writing can be
completed without it.

You have thoughts that are burning to be expressed. Great writing comes when you
describe those ideas in a way that other people can participate in your passion.
It is compelling and sharp. It is an invitation to a deeper understanding.

You undoubtedly understand truths that no one else gets. What makes you angry?
What creates fear? When do you feel disgust? What melts your heart? These are
the truths that must be reflected in your writing.

If you do not have that passion then don't write. If you do not know truths
that others are missing then don't write. No tactical skill will make writing
interesting if it lacks passion.

If you are truly passionate about something then it is probably tied to your
primary purpose in life. Think about these areas and they will be a constant source
of inspiration to you.
