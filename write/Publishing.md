# Traditional Publishing

Traditionally the publishing industry has focused on printing and distributing books, magazines, and
newspapers.   Each of these venues differ in the scope and frequency of publication.  It takes
roughly a year to write a book, a monthly to write a magazine, and a week to create a newspaper.
These venues all take teams of people to allow them to have a more frequent publication schedule.
Newspapers are published daily and require a huge staff and circulation to justify their existence.
Magazines are typically published weekly or monthly and also require a huge staff.

Traditional publishers focus on sales as their goal is to make money.  They are only interested in
publishing content with potential for a high volume of readers in order to pay
their bills.  The economic realities drive every decision that is made.

Thirty years ago all literate people read newspapers, magazines, and books in high quantities.  This
was the only way for people to remain informed about the world around them.  


## Internet

That all changed with the introduction of the internet.  By the year 2000, a dramatic social shift
began that changed how we learn, communicate, and even think.  There is no going back to the way
things were before the internet.

The internet now offers everyone a voice.  Because the act of publishing and distribution is so easy
it lets every person become share their ideas with others globally.  This has led to a complete
democratization of communication that once was the sole domain of the publishing houses.

It has also driven an economic collapse of the entire publishing industry across the spectrum, from
newspapers, to magazines, to books.  Many publishers have gone out of business and the ones that
remain are limping badly.


## Reading Habits

The internet has initiated a tectonic shift in the way readers expect to access content.  Now, social
media (driven by the dominance of Facebook and Twitter) has become the way most people stay
informed.  Readers now expect content to be free and are reluctant to pay money for
information.

There has also been a dramatic shift in quality.  In the 90s the publishing industry was based on
reputation.  Any publisher that was found guilty of falsehood or lies was quickly ruined. This is
no longer the case.

The new unwritten law is to entertain or enrage the readers.  Education and credibility are not a
factor in most content sources.  The landscape has changed to highlight the people with the most
extreme views rather than the highest credibility.

Everyone is viewed as equally credible in this new world.  Since drama sells extremism is rewarded.
Each self proclaimed pundant (whether amateur or pro) expresses opinions without facts to back it
up.   Readers are bored with dry commentary when they could watch a school-yard brawl.

My students were born after the internet changed the world.  This has created a very short attention
span.  They find info about any subject by typing "google".   After they read a page of text they
are satisfied that know what they need and move on to the next thing.  I expect that most of them
will live life without every reading a non-fiction book that was not assigned.

I teach my students to design their websites to work in this new reality.   Readers on the internet
will make a decision about whether your web page is worthwhile in less that 10 seconds.  If they
stay you may have five minutes to deliver your message.


## Adapt or Die

This new world presents unprecedented challenges for both publishers and authors.  Fiction is about
story telling and enjoying a good story and will always draw readers.  But non-fiction is about
learning, and free resources will completely replace the commercial enterprises that exist today.

I have learned to never bet against a trend.  When there is a global change there is no going back.
No amount of nostalgia or struggle will stop the tides of time.  There  will never be a day when
traditional publishing reigns like it did in the past.

I predict the following trends will rule the future.

- Authors will begin to self-publish and hire marketing agencies to handle marketing and publicity.
- Print-on-demand services will make every ebook available in paper copies.
- Traditional publishing houses will become marketing firms, rather than book manufacturers and
  distributors.
- Most book prices will cap out below $20 (including textbooks)
- Educational publishers will be converted into certification agencies that offer official
  endorsements on the credibility of content.

It is time to learn about the new normal and change to adapt.  That is the only way to flourish in
the new reality. smaller payload, more frequent, and links.  Following the traditional path is a
road toward bankruptcy. Just as commercial retail was completely reinvented based on the internet
age, so too, publishing is being radically transformed.
