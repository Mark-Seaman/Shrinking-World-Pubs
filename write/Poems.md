# A Mark of Poetry

Over the last few months I've been writing poems.  I am finding great joy in the
process of writing.

I've been writing creative non-fiction for several years now, but the poetry bug
is relatively new.  In the non-fiction work I spend time discussing how
everything is all connected.  This leads me to discuss many topics that are
loosely tied to the primary subject.

Poems are completely different for me.  They do not require an explanation. 
Poems are about evoking the imagination and triggering emotions.  Therefore I
find it easier to jump right to the heart of a matter and spin a few phrases
that evoke.  This allows me to skip providing the details and lets the reader
fill in their own details if needed.

Everyday life is full of irony and awe that poetry captures better than prose.
I hope you enjoy this collection of poems.

Check out my poems at [SeamansLog.com/poem](https://seamanslog.com/poem/Index). 
I'm thinking about publishing them as a Amazon Kindle e-book.  Your feedback
would be very much appreciated.
