# Repositioning Cruise

Every voyage begins with expectations. We envision the final destination and prepare ourselves for the journey ahead.
But sometimes, life throws unexpected twists and turns our way, and this was certainly the case for us.

From the start, I knew this voyage would be a transition. After a year of feeling overwhelmed and burned out from all my
commitments and work, my wife and I decided it was time to retire. Even though I had tried to retire a few times before,
it never quite stuck. But this time, I was determined to make a major change in our lifestyle.

To mark this new chapter in our lives, we booked a cruise that would take us across the vast Atlantic and through the
breathtaking lands of Scandinavia. It was truly the trip of a lifetime, one that we both desperately needed. We were
to spend a month on a cruise ship, traveling from Florida to Estonia. There would be no work, no commitments, and no internet.

Many cruise ships reposition themselves twice a year, moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Europe in the spring and back for 
the winter.  This is a great way to cut off all ties to the world and just relax and enjoy the journey.  We were looking
forward to the time to reflect on our lives and to plan for the future.   

We planned on long hours on our balcony, watching the sea go by, and long walks on the deck.  We were looking forward to
the time to read, to talk, and to just be together.

Little did
we know at the time, our journey would be about more than work/life balance. Within weeks Stacie had lost her battle with cancer.
Her voyage was to be from this life to the next.  My voyage was to be from a life of shared experiences to a life of flying solo.
The transition was to be a profound repositioning of my very existence.

Now this voyage is more than just a nice vacation.   It will involve hours of difficult mental and emotional work as I 
attempt to reposition myself in a world that no longer includes Stacie.  It will be a time of reflection, a time of
renewal, and a time of deep personal growth. It will be a time to find a new purpose and a new identity. 

We deliberately chose a repositioning cruise to symbolize the start of our new life, knowing that it would be vastly
different from what we were used to. Spending a month on a ship far surpassed any previous vacation we had taken. Our
dream was to be surrounded by the vast ocean, giving us ample time to contemplate our future together.

However, with Stacie's untimely passing, the idea of crossing and repositioning took on an even deeper significance.
What was once an act of rebuilding our lives together now became a solo task for me. Everything we had done for decades
had been done side by side, and now I had to navigate this new journey alone, pondering what the remainder of my life
should look like.

Initially, I considered canceling the voyage altogether. But my children, in their wisdom, encouraged me to go ahead
with it. They insisted on accompanying me on this meaningful trip, transforming it into a crossing not only over the
Atlantic, but a crossing over the vast ocean that separated my old life from the new. In a way, just like the ship
repositions itself to operate in a brand new theater, I too am repositioning myself for a brand new chapter in my life.
