# The Voyage Begins

From the start, the voyage was expected to be a transition. After a difficult year of over commitment and overwork, my wife and I realize that it was time to retire. I had already tried several times to retire, but it never stuck. Now was the time finally to have a major change in our lifestyle.

To the occasion we booked a cruise that would take us across the Atlantic and throughout Scandinavia. It was the trip of a lifetime, and it was greatly needed. Not only were we about to cross the Atlantic, but our lives would transition from the old way of doing things to a brand new way.

At the time we had no idea what transitions were about to take place, but they were far more substantial than we could ever have guessed. Stacie's voyage would take her into eternity, and my voyage would take me from my life with Stacie into a new solo.

Every voyage starts with expectations. We believe we know the final destination, and we understand the way to get there we spend much time preparing for our expectations to be met. Sometimes the journey is far different than what we expect - this was the case for us.

Cruise ships operate in the Gulf of Mexico during the winter and our reposition to operate in Europe during the summer. In the spring, and again in fall, the ships are repositioned to operate in the new theater. This repositioning cruise offers passengers, a luxurious time of rest and reflection as they travel from arena into another.

We chose a repositioning cruise to commemorate our new life, realizing that it would be different than the life we were living. We would be on a ship for a month. this far exceeded any vacation that we had ever taken. Our dream was to spend the time at Sea, contemplating our new future.

With Stacy's passing this idea of crossing, and repositioning, took on an even greater significance. Now the act of rebuilding a life would be a solo task for me. Wow everything we did for decades was done together I would now be on my own to think about, what life should be like for the remainder.

My initial instinct was to cancel the voyage altogether, but my kids encouraged me to go ahead and take the voyage. They volunteered to accompany me on this important trip. Now the trip has taken on new significance as a crossing not just over the Atlantic but the ocean that stands between my old life and the new.  I am indeed repositioning, even as the ships are doing to operate in a brand new theater.
