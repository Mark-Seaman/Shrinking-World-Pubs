# Our History

## Engineering

Over the last 40 years Mark Seaman has been building software and perfecting
the process of software development.

In 25 years at Hewlett-Packard Mark worked on a wide variety of products and
technologies (including Disk Drives, Scanners, Cameras, Printers, Personal
Computers.  His roles included all of the activities required for software
development.

During this time, Mark developed a passion for understanding how humans
can create software more effectively.  As the industry developed Mark was
often on the forefront of technology and frequently brought in new
technologies to HP by training other team members.

Mark was one of the first practitioners of Scrum for Agile Software
Development and has trained many people throughout the years.  Mark was
also an early adopter of Object-Oriented development and Test-driven
Development.

Mark founded Shrinking World Solutions in 2007 to deliver engineering
services and training for software development.  Most of the software
developed recently has been for the world wide web and mobile devices.

Over his career he has developed two to three medium sized applications
every year.  For most of the applications that were delivered for
Shrinking World, Mark was the only software developer.

Over the last forty years Mark has developed over 100 different applications
and written around 2 million lines of code personally.



## Training

Throughout his career Mark has consistently been involved in training
others in software skills.  First in his job at Hewlett-Packard, then
later at Shrinking World and recently at University of Northern Colorado.

No matter what the context is, Mark loves to learn and share best practices
with others.  As a lifelong learner he is constantly perfecting new skills
and passing them along to others.

Mark has trained hundreds of engineers and business people in web development.
He hopes to train thousands before he is done.

In 2015 Mark wrote a book on best practices of software engineering, called the
Leverage Principle.  He has also written course materials for four courses.

In addition to the professional contributions, Mark has developed numerous personal
websites and blogs over the years.  As an author his passion for best practice
extends beyond software to other topics.  Check out the

writing.

As a trainer Mark is currently producing over 1,000 pages of course content
each year.  This is the equivalent of writing three textbooks each year. In his
spare time he teaches as an Adjunct Professor of Web Development at University
of Northern Colorado.
