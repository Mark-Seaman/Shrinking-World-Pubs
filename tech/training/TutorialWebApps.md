# Tutorial - Building Web Apps   (1/2 day tutorial)


## TITLE

Building Web Apps with Python, by Mark Seaman


# Speaker Bio

Mark Seaman grew up building imaging software for Hewlett-Packard. Then he owned a software
engineering company for over a decade. Now he teaches web development and software engineering at
the University of Northern Colorado. His passions can be summed up as being a teacher, author, 
and inventor.

Software is everything and everything can be software.


## DESCRIPTION

Django offers a very effective way to build web apps for computers and mobile devices. It 
provides most of the functionality that is common to every web app.

Learning to build an app can be a little daunting. This class offers a gentle introduction
to Django development that does not assume any prior knowledge of Django. Students are expected to
be able to read Python code, but the Django details will be explained as we go.

After this class, participants will understand how to continue their journey of building web apps.

* You will know how to overcome the common challenges of installing the development tools and 
selecting a hosting environment for their app.
* You will learn how to build apps from scratch and add views and a database. 
* You will learn to create data models and migrate the database structures. 
* You will also learn how to do test-driven development.

Students will be provided with a code repo that contains demo apps they can use to 
expand their learning. All of the key concepts that make Django such a powerful tool will be
explained and demonstrated.

Participants will leave with a clear picture of how to proceed with building their first Django app.
By exposing students to running code, they can achieve the quick win that
can be so elusive for beginners.

This course is introductory and does not cover topics in depth but instead is designed to explore
the big picture and show participants where to go to get additional information. There are lots of
pointers to great free information on the internet.


## AUDIENCE

This class provides an overview of Django and points students to live code that they can use to
jump-start their development project. If you have been thinking about learning to build apps with
Django this is your lucky day.

This class assumes that you can read and write Python code. We start by discussing
development tools, hosting, and how to build a simple app using Django. Then we explore views,
data, and testing.

Students will also receive access to a Git Repository filled with apps that you can build on. These
apps will provide live examples of how to implement many Django details.


## FORMAT

* Lectures with Demos - The concepts are presented with slides.  About half of all the lecture time
  will be code demos to illustrate the teaching.
* Internet Resources - Participants will be directed to numerous internet resources throughout the
  class. This will allow them to continue their exploration independently. Part of what makes
  learning Django difficult is the enormity of the information available. I will direct students
  toward high-value resources to reduce this confusion.

## EXPERIENCE

I have been teaching at a university as an adjunct professor for the past
five years. Prior to that I was a software developer at a large corporation for 25 years.

At the university I have built three classes.

* Intro to Web Development (using HTML, CSS, JS)
* Intermediate Web Development (using Python, Django, Postgres)
* Software Engineering

I've built 2-3 medium-sized web apps each year for the past 27 years. Django is my primary
development framework. I enjoy the thrill of teaching others to use Django effectively.

I wrote the course material for teaching how to build web apps with the matching textbook.  
I fine-tuned this material over several semesters.

This tutorial is extracted and abbreviated from the 14-week course. It covers roughly weeks 
1, 3, 4, and 5 in the full course. This material has also been taught as a one-day seminar at the
university.

I've taught both in-person and with video, and see the merits of both. My goal with the tutorial is
to pass on lessons that I've learned while teaching others.
