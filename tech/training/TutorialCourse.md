# Tutorial - Course Creation  (1/2 day tutorial)


## TITLE

Building course content for online teaching, by Mark Seaman


# Speaker Bio

Mark Seaman grew up building imaging software for Hewlett-Packard. Then he owned a software
engineering company for over a decade. Now he teaches web development and software engineering at
the University of Northern Colorado. His passions can be summed up as being a teacher, author, 
and inventor.

Software is everything and everything can be software.


## DESCRIPTION

Teaching programming is different than many other types of teaching. This requires careful
consideration of how students learn new technical skills.

In this tutorial, learn how you can use standard design patterns to create courses that are engaging
for students. Use agile practices to create more effective courses with appropriate pacing to
maximize the learning experience.

We will explore how weekly projects create hands-on learning as students apply their new knowledge.
Video lectures teach students the skills they lack to complete each project. While watching the
video the students can follow along with demos and pause it while they produce the desired results.
This technique allows students to learn by doing.

We will examine how to select the content for the course to match the appropriate pacing. You will
learn how to convert a high-level outline into detailed lessons for each session. Then we will
explore how to craft each session of the course with notes, slides, and video.

We will finish by using an online software tool I developed called Sensei Digital Classroom. This
software lets you create content for the course. It also presents the course materials to students
and tracks the students' progress throughout the course.

I wrote the Sensei Platform software for my own teaching and am making it available to anyone who
wishes to use it. It is open-source software and useful for building and delivering your courses to
students.

This course will introduce the techniques and tools that will help you deliver effective courses
while managing the required effort.  


## AUDIENCE

This class is an introduction and does not require any special knowledge. Any experience with 
teaching technology will make the content more relevant.

This tutorial will be useful to technology teachers (either formal or informal) interested in
developing effective courses for programming languages, frameworks, open-source projects, and
application development.

This tutorial will also be useful for anyone who is leading innovation teams where learning is 
critical to their success.  They will learn how to create targeted minicourses (with reduced 
scope compared to a college class).

## EXPERIENCE

I have been teaching at a university as an adjunct professor for the past
five years. During that time I have built three classes.

* Intro to Web Development (using HTML, CSS, JS)
* Intermediate Web Development (using Python, Django, Postgres)
* Software Engineering

Teaching these courses led me to develop a website to present the course content to students. Over 
several years this has evolved into a software platform that allows authors to create new courses.

I've written two books using the techniques I teach in this tutorial.  

I've taught both in-person and with video, and see the merits of both. My goal with the tutorial is
to pass on lessons that I've learned in the school of hard knocks and make things easier for others.
