# Info Content Math

The teaching payload represents the amount of content delivered to the consumer in one chunk.  There
are a series of levels that range in size from 50 words to 80,000 works.  These levels can be
viewed as a nested set of containers that are arranged in an information hierarchy.

Let's look at how this plays out in three different teaching contexts.  While each type of
presentation appears very different, the similarity is remarkable.  Understanding how information
is nested leads to a much clearer presentation while still allowing creative freedom.


**Information Content**

- 80,000 words = 20-hour talk = 20-hours video
- 1,000 words = 20-minute talk = 20-minute video
- 250 words = 5-minute talk = 5-minute video

### Weekly Blog

- Delivery: 50 posts each year
- Info Content: 400 words/post
- Words: 20,000 words = 400 words/post * 50 posts

### Weekly Sermon
