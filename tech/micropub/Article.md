## Basis for Teaching

Articles form the the basis for all teaching. Most class room lessons are constructed to fit this patten.
Humans have a natural attention span of about 20 minutes.  That is why the
TED talks have an ideal length of 18 minutes to allow the listeners to maximize
the experience. Within this time of intense concentration a great deal of 
information can be absorbed.

A well crafted teaching is built around a single idea but also includes
several supporting ideas. This one lesson can be delivered personally as
a lecture with or without visual aides or as written text with or without 
images. The multiple formats can be considered a different forms containing
the same exact information. It is often wise to produce multiple forms at the
same time.

The teaching or lesson embodies the key unit of publishing for an author. The
article should be self-contained and understandable by anyone without requiring
them to read other content.


## Article Payload Size

In twenty minutes of speaking there is an exchange of about 1000 words.
This is represented by about four pages of typewritten text.  Publishers count
pages as having 250 words.  This gives us an easy equivalency to measure the 
size of content being created.

- 1000 words, 4-5 pages, 
- 20-30 minute talk or recorded video

## Article Structure

A well crafted teaching has an internal structure.  When you watch any TED talk
you can quickly identify this structure. These lectures are works of craftsmanship
that are the best representation of teaching available.

Each teaching can be built upon one key ideas with four supporting ideas.  
Each of these could be represented by a stand-alone Post in the Micropub words.  
This gives us a structure the follows the 1 + 4 logic pattern.

This structure is often explicitly shown within the presentation of subsections
in written text or as sections in presentation slides.

The content should build on the other information within the article but should 
have minimal requirements on external references.  This allow the consumers to
completely understand the concepts without depending on other resources.


## Links

No information lives in a vacuum.  Everything connects to related topics.
A key idea with Micropublishing is to establish those connections explicitly.
Every article is linked to related topics within a complex web of connections.

There are many possible connections for any given article.  It is best to 
focus on a few recommendations for further study.  Providing too many links 
undermines their value.  Consider linking to the 3 or 4 most relevant articles
to follow up or expand on the ideas here.

Show links that reflect the natural hierarchy of the article nesting.  This 
strengthens the big picture for the student reading the material.
Each article may be a part of a seminar or larger teaching structure.  
The links should promote this idea.
