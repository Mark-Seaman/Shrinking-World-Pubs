# The Lesson

## Class Lecture and the Sermon

A human can only take in so much new information at any one time. This psychological limitation 
has led educators to explore how to teach adults most effectively.  Over time a social pattern 
has emerged that represents the best practice for adult learning.

There seems to be a fundamental limit of 20 to 30 minutes of intense concentration and focus that
drives how we expect to learn.  This sets an upper limit for the duration of the typical lecture.
Standard patterns have emerged for teaching adults in a number of different settings, from the
college class session to the weekly sermon. TED Talks are designed to be 18 minutes in length.

Over the last fifty years, these venues have become the typical way that most people think about
learning.  While it is rare for adults to enroll in college courses, the time spent in college sets
a certain expectation that affects how we view education.

People expect to learn in a certain way and are conditioned to the natural rhythms associated with
the pace of learning.  These two patterns have completely dominated the way that teaching is done
and are worth examining through the lens of Info Content Structure.


## Frequency & Duration

The total amount of content that is taught during the course of a year is amazingly similar despite
the differences in how it is delivered.  The frequency and duration of each engagement varies
greatly depending on the delivery vehicle.  The shorter the engagement, the more frequently it is
delivered.


## College Class

A semester course runs for 15 weeks with 3 sessions per week.  Each of the almost 50 sessions
carries about 30 minutes of new information content as well as assessments and homework.  30
minutes of information is roughly equivalent to 6 pages (or 1600 words) of written content.  A
class textbook would cover about 18 pages (one chapter) of material each week.

Human psychology must dictate that there is an optimal amount of attention that can be given to
absorb new information.  30 minutes of intense learning seems to be a natural limit.  That would
explain the standardization of the three day course week, rather than the 3 hours in one session.

This provides opportunity to consider and integrate the knowledge.  Applying the knowledge also lets
it take hold at a much deeper level.  The frequency and duration then can be stated for a college
class as:

- 50 sessions for 30 minutes for 5 pages of information
- during the course the student will probably invest 100 hours of actual mindshare in the class
- 15 weeks of investing 7 hours/week
- Session mindshare: Absorb -30 minutes, Apply - 90 minutes


## Weekly Sermon

Church people expect to be taught for about 20-30 minutes each week.   The Sunday service is built
around this teaching experience.  If the teaching lasts for longer than 30 minutes the crowd grows
restless.

Human psychology must dictate that there is an optimal amount of attention that can be given to
absorb new information.  This sets the 30-minute limit on the teaching within a single session.
People then have a week to think about what was said.

The frequency and duration then can be stated for a regular set of teachings as:

- 50 sessions for 30 minutes for 5 pages of information
- during the year people will probably invest 100 hours of actual mindshare
- 50 weeks investing 2 hours/week
- Session mindshare: Absorb -30 minutes, Apply - 90 minutes


## Total Engagement

We can say that the total engagement for a student in a college class is roughly equivalent to the
desired engagement that is sought for church members over the course of an entire year.   A
semester takes one-third of the year and we seek to engage the student for 6 hours weekly.  The
church teaching is seeking to occupy the mind for 2 hours each week.  These expectations have been
in place since the 1950s.

The actual engagement in both of these situations can be far lower if the student is unmotivated.
The crafting of the content is a vital factor to create the motivation for the student to learn.
Moving too fast or slow or presenting too much or too little info in a single sitting can cause
students to become disengaged.
