# The Internet (1990s)

From the early eighties each decade has brought in new technologies that have
revolutionized how we live our lives. The 1990s was no exception. So many
developments would change the world in fundamental ways.


## Early 90s

By the early 90s personal computers were everywhere.  Business people would buy
computers for the home to increase their competitiveness at work. Businesses
were buying computers to automate all of the tasks that had previously been done
with paper.  

Computer literacy had become one of the great enablers of effectiveness in the
workplace.  The killer apps were bundled as Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Power
Point) for spreadsheets, documents, and presentations.

In the early 90s HP began investing in communication technology.  The leaders
believed that in the future  computers would be used primarily for
communication, rather than computing. They were totally right in this regard.


## Message Exchanges

There were bulletin board systems (such as Prodigy, Compuserve, and AOL), where
regular people could log in and trade messages with others.  Email had been
around for several years but it was difficult to configure and  maintain.  This
made it out of reach for most people.  AOL became the primary way that people
were able to exchange email.

Access to all of these systems was done over dial-up connections with modems.
The fast modems ran at 120 characters/second (1200 baud) while the slow one were
30 characters/second.  The phone lines were  blocked during the connection so
people kept it brief.

First, large corporations, and later all businesses, started busing email.  The
servers and client email boxes required dedicated IT staff to keep it running
and it was quite costly.

ARPANET  had demonstrated how to connect computers and exchange data throughout
the world.  Ethernet protocols showed how computers could be connected onto a
LAN (Local Area Network).   Communication networks of the era were a total mess;
there was no standardization and every company  had to solve many difficult
problems to integrate computer systems together.


## The Internet Arrives on Main Street

The brilliance of the internet is found in its simplicity.  There are a few
powerful but simple standards that can be easily implemented on every computer
in the world.  Today there is somewhere around 100 million secure internet
servers waiting for your call.

To get a reliable connection between computer there must first be a way to talk
between two computers. The Ethernet standard governs how to talk over a LAN,
while the IP (Internet Protocol) allow computers to be addressed.  The TCP
(Transport Control Protocol) governs how information packets are exchanged.

An addressing scheme uses commercial systems (Routers) to routes data packets to
any machine in the world. This allows for the world's computers to each have a
unique address.  This addressing method is quite robust because there is no
single place where the information is stored.

It is impossible to destroy the internet.  Computers can be added and removed
but the internet continues to exist.  This makes it extremely hardy and robust.


## Netscape and Internet Explorer

In 1993 the release of Mosaic began a series of web browsers that gave computer
users access to the World Wide Web. This opened up a whole new range of
applications that had never been practical before.  Rather than just sending 
specific messages from senders to receivers, the web allows business to build
web pages that could be viewed by interested parties.

The World Wide Web popularized the internet and made it a part of everyday life
around the world.  Internet use increased as a result of the reduction of the
"digital divide" and advances in connectivity, uses of the Internet, and
computer education. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the
United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35% as computer ownership
progressed from a luxury to a necessity.

Control of the web browser software was viewed as a major competitive advantage
because it would allow vendors to control customer behavior.  Mosaic (which
would later morph into Netscape and then Mozilla Firefox) was the  primary
browser being used at the time.  

Microsoft felt that it was extremely important to control the web browser, so in
Windows 95 Internet Explorer shipped with the operating system.  By 2003
Microsoft had captured 95% of  the internet users.  Later this trend has shifted
toward Firefox and Google Chrome.


## Digital Images

In the late 80s I started working on scanner software and OCR.  In that era the
computers were barely capable of working with image data due to both hardware
and software limitations.

We were building software that went with our scanners.  As the capability of the
hardware and operating systems increased we were quick to build features into
the software that could provide more value to customers.  This sparked the 
most innovative time in my career.

Here are some of technologies that we developed throughout the 90s.

* Software to scan images 
* Sending images directly to other application software
* Automatic image detection and page decomposition
* OCR and word-level recognition
* Creating editable, rich text documents
* Image editing application software
* Automatic image enhancement for color, focus, contrast
* Photo layout application
* Photo management software
* Internet sharing services for photos

I went from being a programmer to being a team leader and expert in software
engineering. My best season was leading a team to build a complete suite of
application software that shipped with our Digital Cameras.  

During this time I was able to 25 invention disclosures and was awarded 12 international patents.


## Mac and Windows Development

Software tool evolved rapidly during the 1990s.  The tools that we used were
typically dictated by the operating systems of the computers that our products
were run on.  HP customers were split between Mac and Windows machines.

On the Microsoft Windows platform the development tools moved from Windows SDK
(1992) to MFC  (1992) to Java (1996) to Visual Studio - .Net Framework (2000).
Mac Development tools included MacApp (1985), Metrowerks CodeWarrior (1993), and
Xcode (2003).  Every few years we were forced to rewrite all of our software to
accommodate the new tools and features of the newer hardware and software.

Our products needed to support a large variety of Image file formats - including
Tiff, JPEG, GIF and Image transfer protocols - Twain & OLE.


## eCommerce

By 1995 everyone knew that eCommerce would be big someday, but there was no
viable and secure way to exchange money that people could truly trust.

Amazon.com was one of the first websites to gain people's trust.   Customers
could buy books there and they would be shipped directly to the address on
record.   PayPal was another early player that gained marketshare.  It is hard
to imagine the primitive nature of these simple transactions now in the world as
it exists today.

My first web store was a website that required customers to place an order
online. An email would be sent the customer and then they would call in with
their credit card information.   Although we had PayPal integrated, many would
not trust it and they would prefer to make a phone call to complete the
transaction.


## DotCom Boom/Bust

Soon the world had changed.  Now people couldn't wait to buy every item they
wanted from online.  Amazon went from selling books to selling virtually
everything in the late nineties.  This soon became a gold rush.  Sales boomed
and a huge number of new companies were born.  Every clever person in their 30s
became obsessed with starting a company to capture the profits.

Venture capitalist would pump millions into any startup with a domain name and
an innovative business plan.  We all believed that the old rules about how to
run businesses where old-fashioned and antiquated.  Price to earnings ratios
soared to all time highs.  Profitability became king over meeting real customer
needs and producing value.

In 1999, 12 large-cap stocks rose over  1,000% in value.  Investors sold stocks
in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks. The internet bubble
burst and the boom became a bust.  Many who had invested everything on the
gamble of fast growth and easy money lost it all. The NASDAQ Composite index
spiked in the late 1990s and then fell sharply as a result of the dot-com
bubble.

Reality has a way of asserting itself when we are not paying attention.  A boom,
creates and bubble, and a bust.   It is the way of things.  The early 2000s were
a time of great searching to try and separate the real from the fantasy.  With
the 9/11 attack in 2001 the country was reminded how volatile wealth and power
really are.  And a new era was begun.


## The Wild 90s

The decade began with personal computers that were barely useful.  Except for
businesses that were already using computer systems to collaborate, the 
technology didn't offer an efficient means of communication.  The next five
years would see a communication revolution that was driven by internet adoption.

The last five years of the century, saw massive social change as every household
began to use the internet daily.  People began to think about the Old Economy
as a vestigial legacy of the pre-internet age.
The economic and social transformation that
occurred as a result set up the conditions that would define life in the 21st 
Century.

To understand what would happen next requires putting ourselves in the mindset
of 1999.   For us this was the beginning of the Brave New World, with easy money,
and global power.  The USA had become the only remaining superpower and there
was nothing that could stop our rising prosperity.  America had become king
of the technology stack and we were eager to help the world become a better 
place.
