## Course: Genetics 101

### Course Overview: 

This course will provide high school students with an introduction to the
fascinating world of genetics. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on activities, and
discussions, students will learn about the principles of genetics, the structure and function
of DNA, and the ways in which genetic traits are inherited.

### Course Objectives:

1. To understand the basic principles of genetics, including DNA structure and replication, gene
expression, and inheritance patterns. 

2. To explore the ethical and social implications of genetic
research and genetic engineering. 

3. To develop skills in scientific inquiry, data analysis, and
critical thinking. Course Outline:

## Week 1 Lesson Plan

Lesson Plan: Introduction to Genetics

### Objectives:
- Understand the basic principles of genetics, including DNA structure and replication, gene
  expression, and regulation.
- Learn about the history of genetics and its significance in modern biology.
- Develop an understanding of the scientific method and how it applies to genetics research.

### Materials:
- Textbook: "Genetics: From Genes to Genomes" by Leland Hartwell, et al.
- Whiteboard and markers
- Handouts on DNA structure and function
- Videos on the history of genetics

### Activities:
- Introduction (10 minutes)
    - Welcome students to the class and introduce the topic of genetics.
    - Ask students what they already know about genetics and what they hope to learn in this
      course.
- History of Genetics (30 minutes)
    - Show videos on the history of genetics and its significance in modern biology.
    - Discuss key historical figures in genetics, such as Gregor Mendel, James Watson, and Francis
      Crick.
    - Ask students to identify important discoveries in genetics and how they have impacted modern
      science.
- DNA Structure and Function (60 minutes)
    - Introduce the structure and function of DNA, including base pairing and DNA replication.
    - Use the whiteboard to draw and label the structure of DNA.
    - Distribute handouts on DNA structure and function and ask students to read and summarize key
      points.
- Gene Expression and Regulation (30 minutes)
    - Explain how genes are expressed and regulated, including the roles of transcription and
      translation.
    - Use examples to illustrate how gene expression can be influenced by environmental factors.
    - Ask students to brainstorm possible factors that could influence gene expression.
- Scientific Method (20 minutes)
    - Introduce the scientific method and how it applies to genetics research.
    - Discuss the importance of hypothesis testing, data analysis, and peer review in scientific
      research.
    - Ask students to develop a hypothesis related to genetics and design an experiment to test it.

### Assessment:
- Collect completed handouts on DNA structure and function.
- Assign a homework assignment to write a paragraph summarizing the history of genetics.

### Homework:
- Write a paragraph summarizing the history of genetics, including key historical figures and
  discoveries.
