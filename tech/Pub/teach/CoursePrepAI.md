# Course Prep with AI

Today I woke up with the idea of using AI to create course plans.  I know a lot of people who
are actively building curriculum for different areas of study.  There are many teachers in my 
realm of contacts.

Within a few minutes I had created an outline for a short course to teach Japanese to high school
students. The next course plan I made was for a short class on Genetics.  Then I turned to 
Spiritual Formation and finally I built a class on Creating and Online Teaching Business.

Within an hour I had a very good first-cut at building course content for four different areas
spanning a broad range of topics.  This was all accomplished by issuing prompts into chatGPT to
create the content.  The raw output needed a small amount of minor editing to be closer to my
ideal course plan.

It takes roughly 15 minutes to produce an actionable course plan for a subject of interest.  The
main trick is knowing how to coax chatGPT into producing the desired output.  I've included the
prompts that I used and the final output that was generated.

Get started with chatGPT to try it out for yourself at 
[https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com).  Its free, but you may want to get
faster access for $20/month.

Check out the following case studies.  Keep in mind that this was done in a few minutes.

### Discussion

In this course I gave it a full outline of what I wanted to teach.  These results were less 
satisfying than if I would have let chatGPT develop its own ideas for the course.
