# Shrinking World

Our motto is, "The world is a much smaller place than it used to be,
so learn the skills that will let you thrive!"
Web communication technology has already become a global reality and 
raised the bar for the very concept of literacy.

Founded by Mark Seaman in 2007 to provide Software Engineering and Software
Training focused on web development.

Web communications represent the New Literacy of the modern world.  If you
don't understand web technology  you are not really literate today.
